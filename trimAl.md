# trimAl

> trimAl, a tool for automated alignment trimming, which is especially suited for large-scale analyses. Its speed and the possibility for automatically adjusting the parameters to optimize the phylogenetic signal-to-noise ratios for different families, makes trimAl especially suited for large-scale phylogenomic analyses, involving thousands of large multiple sequence alignments.
>
> trimAl has been implemented in C++ programming language. So far a command-line version to download and a web interface are available.
