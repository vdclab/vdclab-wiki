# ArDock

> Arbitrary docking can reveal potential interaction sites on the surface of a protein using docking with a set of 25 random protein “probes”.
We have shown that the random probes interact in a non-random manner on protein surfaces, and that targeted regions are enriched in biological interfaces.
Docking is performed by the Hex software using spherical polar Fourier Correlations.
