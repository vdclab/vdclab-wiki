# Genome Browser Gateway

> Genome Browser Gateway is a mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, with several dozen aligned annotation tracks.
&NewLine;
This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases.

## User Notes

- The site specializes in Eukaryotic genomes, but also has the Ebola virus (G3683/KM034562.1/eboVir3; June 2014) and SARS-CoV-2 (ASM985889v3/wuhCor1; January 2020) available. 
- Results also provide links to connected databases. 
- Surprisingly E. coli is in this set.

## Ease of Use

The site is relatively easy to use.
