# Genome Browser Gateway

> Genome Browser Gateway is a mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of the genome at any scale, with several dozen aligned annotation tracks.
&NewLine;
This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases.
