# AraNet

> AraNet is a probabilistic functional gene network for Arabidopsis thaliana, which is a model plant organism that has been studied intensively for several decades. Recent advances in omics technology have enabled the generation of an unprecedented amount of data from A. thaliana allowing data-driven approaches to unravel complex gene-to-phenotype association in plants. We previously published a genome-scale functional gene network for A. thaliana, AraNet, by probabilistic integration of heterogeneous omics-data.
