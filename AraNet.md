# AraNet

> AraNet is a probabilistic functional gene network for Arabidopsis thaliana, which is a model plant organism that has been studied intensively for several decades. Recent advances in omics technology have enabled the generation of an unprecedented amount of data from A. thaliana allowing data-driven approaches to unravel complex gene-to-phenotype association in plants. We previously published a genome-scale functional gene network for A. thaliana, AraNet, by probabilistic integration of heterogeneous omics-data.

## Notes from user
- Specific for plants, mostly for arabidopsis
- Can be used to find homologs of gene present in arabidopsis in other plants
- Can be used to visualize gene networks, the user needs Flash player to see the network
- Locus names for genes link to TAIR for annotation information

## Ease of use
> Tutorials are available with several sets of example genes to complete guided case studies with to familiarize the user with the tool. The results are not visually pleasing but the "AUC" score and P values are a nice detail available to the user.
