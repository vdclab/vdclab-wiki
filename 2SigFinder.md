# 2SigFinder

> 2SigFinder is a novel prediction method, the first combined use of small-scale and large-scale statistical testing for genomic island detection. 2SigFinder was tested by genomic island boundary detection and identification of genomic islands or functional features of real biological data. 
>
> From real biological data, 2SigFinder identified genomic islands from a single genome and reported robust results across different experiments, without annotated information of genomes or prior knowledge from other datasets.
