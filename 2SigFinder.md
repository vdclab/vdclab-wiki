# 2SigFinder

> 2SigFinder is a novel prediction method, the first combined use of small-scale and large-scale statistical testing for genomic island detection. 2SigFinder was tested by genomic island boundary detection and identification of genomic islands or functional features of real biological data. 
>
> We also compared the proposed method with the comparative genomics and composition-based approaches. In simulations with alien frag-ments from real genomes, the CG-MJSD searches the maximum of the MJSD score in terms of the GC-content bias, making it much faster in the boundary detection of the genomic islands while main-taining a similar error rate.
>
> From real biological data, 2SigFinder identified genomic islands from a sin-gle genome and reported robust results across different experiments, without annotated information of genomes or prior knowledge from other datasets.
