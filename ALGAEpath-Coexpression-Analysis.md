# ALGAEpath Coexpression Analysis

> Coexpression analysis provides gene information and transcript abundance profile of genes which have the similar profile as selected gene. At first, user selects the conditional dataset and gene ID are selected. And the transcript abundance profile are show in the line graph (10 records in a figure). Otherwise, gene information is listed under the figure.
&NewLine;
Here, AlgaePath uses Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient based on Variance-Stabilizing Transformation (VST) normalization to generate correlation results.
