# Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial Genomes / Virus

> The mission of the Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes(IMG/M) system is to support the annotation, analysis and distribution of microbial genome and microbiome datasets sequenced at DOE's Joint Genome Institute (JGI).
&NewLine;
IMG/M is also open to scientists worldwide for the annotation, analysis, and distribution of their own genome and microbiome datasets, as long as they agree with the IMG/M data release policy and follow the metadata requirements for integrating data into IMG/M (see IMG/M submission site).
