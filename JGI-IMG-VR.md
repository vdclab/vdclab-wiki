# Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial Genomes / Virus

> The mission of the Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes(IMG/M) system is to support the annotation, analysis and distribution of microbial genome and microbiome datasets sequenced at DOE's Joint Genome Institute (JGI).
&NewLine;
IMG/M is also open to scientists worldwide for the annotation, analysis, and distribution of their own genome and microbiome datasets, as long as they agree with the IMG/M data release policy and follow the metadata requirements for integrating data into IMG/M (see IMG/M submission site).

## Website

- [JGI IMG/VR *Main Page*](https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/vr/main.cgi)
{.links-list}

## Notes from users 
Genome browser that can be used for finding specific genes/functions or to compare genomes. The website also offers searchable OMICS data.

## Ease of use
Offers a quick search function and also a more in-depth broswer. Has an outdated look but is quite functional. Able to filter protein function data with Pfam, KEGG, phenotypes, and other types of annotations from other websites.
