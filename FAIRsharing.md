# FAIRsharing

> FAIRsharing is an informative and educational resource that describes and interlinks community-driven standards, databases, repositories and data policies. As of February 2019, FAIRsharing has over 2,620 records: 1,293 standards, 1,209 databases and 118 data policies (of which 82 are from journals and publishers and 23 from funders), covering natural sciences (for example, biomedical, chemistry, astronomy, agriculture, earth sciences and life sciences), engineering, and humanities and social sciences.
>
> FAIRsharing also contains recommendations, which are a core-set of resources that are selected or endorsed by data policies from journals, funders or other organizations.
