-# Domain Mapping of Disease Mutations

> Domain mapping of disease mutations (DMDM) is a database in which each disease mutation can be displayed by its gene, protein or domain location. DMDM provides a unique domain-level view where all human coding mutations are mapped on the protein domain.
>
> DMDM's protein domain view highlights molecular relationships among mutations from different diseases that might not be clearly observed with traditional gene-centric visualization tools.

## Notes from the user
 - Users are searching for domains rather than specific proteins
 - Logos of the most frequently occurring amino acids are laid on top of histograms for mutation rates at each position
 - List of diseases and mutation are available for each entry
 - Not up to date

 
## Ease of use

Despite the dated appearance of the tool, the information and data integration are rather unique and informative. Users can quickly assess how important certain domains are in diseases or how prone to mutation the domains are.


## Help

No tutorial or guided practice but example queries are availabe.
