# EZBioCloud

> EzBioCloud is ChunLab's public data and analytics portal focusing on taxonomy, ecology, genomics, metagenomics, and microbiome of Bacteria and Archaea. Our new cloud service includes bioinformatics tools and succeeds our previous databases, which include EzTaxon, EzTaxon-e, and EzGenome.

## Notes from users 

This should be the first step to be done when working a new gene. It allows to extract papers on several members of a protein family. It is important however to check the links manually. Searches also will miss some references that are not open access and have not mentioned the protein Locus_tag in the abstract/title.  

## Ease of use 

No specific help, but very easy to use and self-explanatory
