# EZBioCloud

> EzBioCloud is ChunLab's public data and analytics portal focusing on taxonomy, ecology, genomics, metagenomics, and microbiome of Bacteria and Archaea. Our new cloud service includes bioinformatics tools and succeeds our previous databases, which include EzTaxon, EzTaxon-e, and EzGenome.

## Notes from users 
A website with several cloud based services available that draw from several unique databases. The list of databases are described by their creators below.

**EzBioCloud 16S Database:** 16S rRNA gene provides the taxonomic framework for the whole EzBioCloud database. Basically, all species or subspecies are represented by single 16S sequence, usually from type strains. Hierarchical classification is based on 16S-maximum likelihood phylogeny

**EzBioCloud Genome Database:** All genome sequences included in EzBioCloud were processed by the same annotation pipeline, so can be directly compared without a problem of incompatibility. Genomes were validated by various QC processes, and taxonomic identities were checked by our TrueBac TM ID service. All genomes in this database are labeled with taxonomic names that are always present in EzBioCloud 16S Database

**EzBioCloud Microbiome Database:** An MTP (Microbiome Taxonomic Profile) is a unit of data containing the taxonomic profile of a metagenomic sample. We compiled 16S microbiome data, which are publicly available, into this database. To access this database, you need to use EzBioCloud system.

**EzBioCloud 16S Database for QIIME and MOTHUR packages:** Whole database including 16S sequences and complete taxonomic hierarchy can be downloaded for the use with QIIME & MOTHUR packages. This database is usually different from EzBioCloud 16S database that is updated more frequently. Sequences and taxonomic hierarchy of EzBioCloud Microbiome Database are directly linked to this database

## Ease of use 
The website is very modern and pleasant to look at and has several tabs at the top of the page that classify their services.
**Resources:** a list of databases offered by EZBioCloud
**Apps:** web-based software specialized for Identification of Prokaryotes, Microbiome/Metagenomics, and Genomics.
**Tools:** tools to assist with larger bioinformatic studies, such as the Average Nucleotide Identity Calculator. These tools are available online or as standalone software.

This website offers a wide variety of apps and tools to in a user friendly format to conduct genomics based projects.
