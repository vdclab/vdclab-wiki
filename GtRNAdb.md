# Genomic tRNA Database

> This genomic tRNA database contains tRNA gene predictions made by the program tRNAscan-SE on complete or nearly complete genomes. Unless otherwise noted, all annotation is automated, and has not been inspected for agreement with published literature. 
&NewLine;
Inevitably with automated sequence analysis, we find exceptions to general identification rules, isoacceptor type predictions (esp. due to variable post-transcriptional anticodon modification), and questionable tRNA identifications (due to pseudogenes, SINES, or other tRNA-derived elements). We attempt to document all cases we come across, and welcome feedback (lowe @soe.ucsc.edu) on new or unrecognized discrepancies.
