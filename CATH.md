# CATH

> The CATH database is a free, publicly available online resource that provides information on the evolutionary relationships of protein domains. It was created in the mid-1990s by Professor Christine Orengo and colleagues, and continues to be developed by the Orengo group at University College London.

## Notes from User
- User friendly, easy interface
- Searches supported by top keywords to help filter (word cloud)
- Good for understanding superfamilies (in context to other superfamilies and metrics of superfamily)
