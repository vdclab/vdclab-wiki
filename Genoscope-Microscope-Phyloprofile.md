# Genoscope Phyloprofile Exploration

> This interface allows the user to search for common OR specific genes/regions between a query genome and other genomes or replicons chosen from the ones available in our PkGDB database (i.e, (re)annotation of bacterial genomes) or complete proteome downloaded from the RefSeq/WGS sections.
{.is-info}

## Notes from user
- A good tool for comparing genomes between organisms 
- Locus tags for results are standardized
- Results are easy to view and understand

## Ease of use
> The tool is simple to use and gives a quick idea of shared genes. The results are much easier to understand than other homolog finding tools.
