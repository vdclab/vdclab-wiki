# UniProt

> The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) is a comprehensive resource for protein sequence and annotation data. The UniProt databases are the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), the UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef), and the UniProt Archive (UniParc). The UniProt consortium and host institutions EMBL-EBI, SIB and PIR are committed to the long-term preservation of the UniProt databases.
&NewLine;
UniProt is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and the Protein Information Resource (PIR). Across the three institutes more than 100 people are involved through different tasks such as database curation, software development and support.

## Notes from User
- Great ID mapping tool (works with many organism specific IDs)
- Good for gathering information on proteins, can customize columns to protein searches 
- Can use to find locus ID tags/gene IDs (an additional column)
- Good for all domains of life 
- The "Add a publication" button can be used to update an entry
