# YeastEnrichr

> YeastEnrichr is a new gene list enrichment analysis tool for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. YeastEnrichr is derived from Enrichr, the popular web-based software for comprehensive and intuitive gene list enrichment analysis. Data from a variety of publicly available S. cerevisiae databases was processed and integrated to generate a collection of gene set libraries. YeastEnrichr can be accessed via API which are documented in SmartAPI. This makes YeastEnrichr interoperable with other tools and projects.
