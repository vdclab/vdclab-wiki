# InnateDB

> InnateDB is a publicly available database of the genes, proteins, experimentally-verified interactions and signaling pathways involved in the innate immune response of humans, mice and bovines to microbial infection. The database captures an improved coverage of the innate immunity interactome by integrating known interactions and pathways from major public databases together with manually-curated data into a centralised resource. To date, 18,780 interactions have been manually curated by the InnateDB curation team. The database can be mined as a knowledgebase or used with our integrated bioinformatics and visualization tools for the systems level analysis of the innate immune response.

## User Notes
- Similar precautions advised as those for other annotation-curation-dependent accuracy/representativeness
- Heavily focused on mammalian data through an immunity/immunology lens
- Provides download options for datasets and softwares
- See their [Statistics](https://www.innatedb.ca/statistics.do?s=) page for more information on their curation progress
