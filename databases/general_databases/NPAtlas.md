# The Natural Products Atlas

> The Natural Products Atlas is designed to cover all microbially-derived natural products published in the peer-reviewed primary scientific literature. This encompasses bacterial, fungal and cyanobacterial compounds, but does not include compounds from plants, invertebrates or other higher organisms unless these compounds have also been explicitly identified from a microbial source. Compounds from lichens and mushrooms and other higher fungi are included. Compounds from marine macro algae and diatoms are excluded.
>
> Compounds reported exclusively in conference proceedings, M.Sc. and Ph.D. theses, personal communications or the popular press are not included. Currently, the Natural Products Atlas does not include compounds from the patent literature. We are exploring mechanisms to incorporate compounds from patents in the next Atlas release.

## Notes from the user
Excellent for finding information based upon a chemical structure or chemical names, alone, as it applies to bacterial or fungal biosynthesis of natural products, although familiarity with chemical and other nomenclatures may limit the accessibility or user-friendliness in some cases. 
 
## Ease of use
- Relatively straight-forward, appealing user experience design
- Data transparency is clearly a priority of this resource, as missing data is highlighted as a common question/problem/challenge and the site even makes it possible to select a particular database version for searching/browsing
- May require some additional knowledge of chemical structures, producing organisms and/or their products to leverage the tools' optimum potential
