# JGI (Joint Genome Institute)

> The mission of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Joint Genome Institute (JGI), a DOE Office of Science User Facility of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and part of the Biosciences Area, is to advance genomics in support of the DOE missions related to clean energy generation and environmental characterization and cleanup. Supported by the DOE Office of Science, the JGI unites the expertise at Berkeley Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. Located in the Integrative Genomics Building in the heart of the Berkeley Lab campus, atop the hills above Berkeley, California, the JGI is operated by the University of California for the U.S. Department of Energy. JGI provides integrated high-throughput sequencing, DNA design and synthesis, metabolomics and computational analysis that enable systems-based scientific approaches to these challenges.

# JGI pages related on the wiki

Other name for this section could be used. Maybe `tools of the website` or `interesting features` or `Other JGI wiki pages` or `Selected JGI wiki pages` or `Useful JGI sub pages`. Need some reflexion about it
