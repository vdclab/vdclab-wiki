# Yeast Fitness Database

> FitDB is a searchable database of quantitative chemical-genetic interactions based on data in Hillenmeyer et al. (Science 2008). This site provides a graphical interface to the supplementary data presented in [The Chemical Genomic Portrait of Yeast.](http://chemogenomics.stanford.edu/supplements/global/)
&NewLine;
A gene search allows viewing of compounds most sensitive to the gene specified in a heterozygous and homozygous yeast deletion strain, including a view of yeast deletion strains that behave similarly to the gene of interest. Compounds can also be searched to identify heterozygous or homozygous deletion strains exhibiting hypersensitivity to compound, including a view of compounds that behave similarly to the compound of interest.

## Notes from User
- Advanced search allows download as plain text, other advanced features not available yet
- Link on gene pages to SGD does not work, but connects to BioGrid and BioPixie 
- can search both for co-fitness or drug profiles
