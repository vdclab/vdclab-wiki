# PubSEED

> PubSEED - the SEED was created to provide consistent and accurate genome annotations across thousands of genomes and as a platform for discovering and developing de novo annotations. The SEED is a constantly updated integration of genomic data with a genome database, web front end, API and server scripts.

## Notes from User
- Genome browser, subsystems of functionally annotated proteins
- One of the best genome tool to discover gene function by comparative genomics. It was visionary and has never been matched. Unfortunately, it has not been updated in over years so new genomes. 
- Sill very powerful to vizualize gene neigbhorhoods and if one knows how to build Subsystems also very useful.
