# ADOMETA - ADoption of Orphan METabolic Activities

> ADOMETA is a bioinformatics resource designed to predict genes for orphan metabolic activities - known biochemical activities not currently assigned to genes in some or all organisms. ADOMETA returns a ranked list of genes likely to catalyze a given metabolic activity in a selected organism.

## Notes from User 
- Currently for S. cerevisiae, E. coli and B. subtilis only
- Many input options
- Ranked by significance, homology and context. Many measurements used, all described, but takes time to parse through all possible/useful combinations
