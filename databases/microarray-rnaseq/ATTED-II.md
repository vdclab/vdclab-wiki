# ATTED-II

> ATTED-II is a coexpression database for plants that aims to aid in the discovery of relationships of unknown genes within a species. As an advanced coexpression analysis method, multispecies comparisons have the potential to detect alterations in gene relationships within an evolutionary context. However, determining the validity of comparative coexpression studies is difficult without quantitative assessments of the quality of coexpression data. 
&NewLine;
ATTED-II (version 9) provides 16 coexpression platforms for nine plant species, including seven species supported by both microarray- and RNA sequencing (RNAseq)-based coexpression data. Two independent sources of coexpression data enable the assessment of the reproducibility of coexpression.

## Ease of Use

- This website is user friendly with well written instructions and explanations. 

## User Notes

- Users can create interaction networks based on gene co-expression and known protein-protein interactions using the "NetworkDrawer" tool. 
- NetworkDrawer interaction networks can be saved as images or explored in both web-based and stand alone cytoscape.
