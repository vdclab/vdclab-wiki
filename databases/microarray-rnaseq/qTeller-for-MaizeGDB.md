# qTeller for MaizeGDB

> qTeller is a comparative RNA-seq expression platform for comparing expression across the Zea mays genome (B73 RefGen_v4, only) provided by multiple data sources. Comparisons can be done by a user-provided gene list or genomic interval, or to visually compare expression between two genes or conditions. There is also data available to compare gene expression and protein levels for many enzymes. qTeller has been used extensively in maize and other research.

## User Notes

- qTeller accepts only v4 gene IDs (Zm00001), not classical or GRMZM IDs. But they provide a convenient link to a maizeGDB tool to translate the gene names. (Link below)
- The platform has no help page, but you can contact the team via a message on the website, leaving your question/comment and email address.
