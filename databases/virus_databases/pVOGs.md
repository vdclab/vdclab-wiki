# Prokaryotic Virus Orthologous Groups (pVOGs)

> This website provides access to the most recent database 9,518 orthologous groups shared among nearly 3,000 thousand complete genomes of viruses that infect bacteria and archaea (pVOGs). The set of pVOGs keeps growing and may have a wide range of applications in different areas of life sciences including taxonomy, evolutionary genetics, genomic epidemiology, metagenomics, systems biology, ecology, among others.

## Notes from Users
- Sections of the website are at the bottom of the main page.
- Some VOGs are poorly defined, some verification is needed.

## Ease of Use
- Search the site by genome: each column can be searched.
- Search website directly by VOGs.
- All tables of the database can be downloaded.
- Downloadable per VOG: Alignment, tables and HHmers.
