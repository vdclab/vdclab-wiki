# Protein Data Bank in Europe - Knowledge Base (PDBe-KB)

> PDBe-KB (Protein Data Bank in Europe - Knowledge Base) is a community-driven resource managed by the PDBe team, collating functional annotations and predictions for structure data in the PDB archive. PDBe-KB is a collaborative effort between PDBe and a diverse group of bioinformatics resources and research teams.
&NewLine;
PDBe-KB contains data contributed by projects such as SIFTS and FunPDBe and aims to place structures from the PDB in their biological context.

## Website

- [PDBe-KB *Main Page*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/)

## User Notes

- PDBe-KB has no official help page, but users are encouraged to email the support team with questions about use of tools or services: pdbehelp@ebi.ac.uk
- Search results give users information about and links to data about genes, expression, proteins, protein structures and literature.
- There is a lot of available data that is not integrated into the site (for example, published expression data is available but search returns "Not studied or no differential expression found for this gene"), so while useful, this site should not be the users sole source. 

## Ease of Use

The site is easy to use for a general search/information gathering.  If users have a specific need from the database they will need to consult the guides for their specific purpose.
