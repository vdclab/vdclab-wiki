# BV-BRC (Formally PATRIC)

> PATRIC provides integrated data and analysis tools to support biomedical research on bacterial infectious diseases. A variety of published genome, pathway, protein family and transcriptomics data can be analyzed and mined. Users can also upload their personal data for genomic, metagenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic analysis and comparison.

## Notes from User
- This platform is updated every 3 months with the new genomes from NCBI so quite up to date.
- Great genome annoation tool from Fasta files to integrated genome in Patric in a few hours.
- Genome amd feature groups are a great tool to keep track of data you need for your projects.
- Many useful tools such as trees, proteome comparisons and pathway comparisons. 
- Extensive tutorials and help are available through the Help tab.
