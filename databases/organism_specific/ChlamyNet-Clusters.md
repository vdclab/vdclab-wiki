# Clustering and Functional Annotation over ChlamyNet

>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a reference model organism for algal genomics and physiological studies. It is especially interesting to study the evolution of regulatory pathways between algae and higher plants. Additionally, it has recently gained attention as a potential source for biodiesel production. The recent accumulation of RNA-seq data allows researchers to study in detail its transcriptome under different physiological conditions. Up to now these studies had remained fragmented, making necessary integrative approaches based on systems biology. Here we present ChlamyNET a web-based tool for the exploration of a gene co-expression network representing the Chlamydomonas transcriptome under relevant physiolocial conditions.

## Notes from user
- This database is limited to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii data.
- Offers a wealth of curated expression data for more accurate annotation.
- Genes are clustered based on Co-expression and organized into groups based on biological process (Gene-ontology.
- R script is available for power users.

## Ease of use

- The single focus of this tool is to analyze gene expression data to annotate and group Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genes based on biological function. The site lacks a modern design but it's not hard to navigate and has video tutorials/case studies to demonstrate how to use the site. Offers many ways to visualize expression data for user selected genes.
