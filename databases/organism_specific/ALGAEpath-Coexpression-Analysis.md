# ALGAEpath Coexpression Analysis

> Coexpression analysis provides gene information and transcript abundance profile of genes which have the similar profile as selected gene. At first, user selects the conditional dataset and gene ID are selected. And the transcript abundance profile are show in the line graph (10 records in a figure). Otherwise, gene information is listed under the figure.
&NewLine;
Here, AlgaePath uses Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient based on Variance-Stabilizing Transformation (VST) normalization to generate correlation results.

## Notes from user
- Data and genes are limited to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
- Gene expression tools, pathway visualization, gene ontology grouping, and BLAST integration.
- Hasn't been updated since 2014
- Data visualization tools don't seem to work properly

## Ease of use
> This website needs some upkeep before use. The tools seem like they would be good visualization tools for expression data and metabolic pathways but they didn't work when I tried them. The user interface is not bad but the specific results hidden behind several pages that the user needs to navigate.
