# The Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR)

> ViPR is an integrated repository of data and analysis tools for multiple virus families, supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRC) program. ViPR contains information for human pathogenic viruses belonging to the Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Filoviridae, Hepeviridae, Herpesviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, Reoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Togaviridae families, with plans to support additional virus families in the future. 
> 
> ViPR captures various types of information, including sequence records, gene and protein annotations, 3D protein structures, immune epitope locations, clinical and surveillance metadata and novel data derived from comparative genomics analysis. Analytical and visualization tools for metadata-driven statistical sequence analysis, multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree construction, BLAST comparison and sequence variation determination are also provided.

## User Notes

- Straight forward platform for very specific viral database queries
- Pulls from various publicly available databases, as well; curated specifically for viral pathogens, biomolecular sequences of relevance to viral pathogens

## Ease of Use

Slightly tedious in the formatting of the query tool; good for very specific queries; may be easier to perform a larger query with taxa-specific parameters in NCBI or similar database as an alternative, faster method
