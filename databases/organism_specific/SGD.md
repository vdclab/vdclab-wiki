# The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)

> The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) provides comprehensive integrated biological information for the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae along with search and analysis tools to explore these data, enabling the discovery of functional relationships between sequence and gene products in fungi and higher organisms.

## Notes from User
- Comprehensive tools for Saccharomyces from tools for genetic manipulation (restriction site mapper, etc.) to aggregated data of phenotypes and metabolism 
- Easy to use, visually pleasant
- Provides yeast specific literature browsing
- Good for BLAST across fungi 
- Good genome browser for S. cerevisiae
- If the protein family you study has a S. cerevisiae homolog, you have to check it at SGD, one of the besy organism centric resource out there
