# EggNOG Database
> Orthology database that was built on adapting and expanding the original COG Database system, further developing the classification approach through recognizing hierarchical relations between orthologous groups (OGs). Functional annotations from various sources (e.g., SMART, KEGG Orthology, GO) are aggregated per OG for improved functional prediction informed at the global level of a given OG's annotation.

## User Notes
 
 - Beginning with a COG ID, UniProt protein accession ID, or family name, text-based queries can be used to explore annotations of hierarchical orthologous groups (predicted based on both sequence similarity and aggregated sequence annotations of group members)
 - Database also permits for sequence-based search of the same information
 - As recent as the 6.0 release, EggNOG now features a phylogenetic profiling tool (linked above) which uses COGs and taxonomic identifiers as inputs for generating a visual table of absence-presence as conferred by its orthology system
