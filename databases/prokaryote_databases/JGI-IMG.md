# JGI/IMG - Integrated Microbial Genomes/Microbiomes

> The Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system serves as a community resource for analysis and annotation of genome and metagenome datasets in a comprehensive comparative context. The IMG data warehouse integrates genome and metagenome datasets provided by IMG users with a comprehensive set of publicly available genome and metagenome datasets.
