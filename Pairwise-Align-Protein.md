## Website

{.links-list}

## Notes from the user
- A very basic sequence alignment tool
- The only customizable features are the scoring matrices and the score for gaps in sequences

## Ease of use
> The tool is easy to use but the output is simply an alignment score and the two query sequences with gaps added by the program.
