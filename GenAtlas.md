# GenAtlas

> The GenAtlas database provides information on the structure, expression and function of genes, gene mutations and their consequences on diseases. Ontologies used for annotation are constructed to allow a classification in three sub-databases: gene, phenotypes and selected references. 
>
> Information is daily collected and manually annotated from Current Contents/Life Sciences literature. GenAtlas is authored at the Fondation IMAGINE and edited at the Paris Descartes University centre of bioinformatics, under the direction of Dr Alexandra Henrion-Caude.
