# IslandViewer

> This web site was developed so that researchers could easily view and download genomic islands for all published sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes that have been predicted using the the currently most accurate GI prediction methods. Users can also upload their own unpublished genomes for analysis.
&NewLine;
The source code and entire GI data sets are available for download and acknowledgement information is available for those who use our resources. This software and website is developed and maintained by the Brinkman lab at Simon Fraser University, Canada.

## Notes from the user
- A great annotation tool for bacterial and archaeal genomes
- Uses 3rd party prediction software to identify virulence genes and genomic islands
- Each gene is linked to it's entry within the NCBI gene database
- Can be used to compare two genomes

## Ease of use
> This tool is easy to use and has an interactive tutorial of the genome viewer. The user can save different views of their genomes and view them later.
