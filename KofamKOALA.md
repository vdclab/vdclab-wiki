# KofamKOALA

> KofamKOALA assigns K numbers to the user's sequence data by HMMER/HMMSEARCH against KOfam (a customized HMM database of KEGG Orthologs (KOs)). K number assignments with scores above the predefined thresholds for individual KOs are more reliable than other proposed assignments. Such high score assignments are highlighted with asterisks '*' in the output. The K number assignments facilitate the interpretation of the annotation results by linking the user's sequence data to the KEGG pathways and EC numbers.

## Notes from the user
- training available: [Koala tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v4UzjE7K2g&list=PL4K-daRUS2A_FdxH_jNtcECtlZ2JoF6GO&index=12)
- results include aligned sequences for all found sequences

## Ease of use
> This tool is as easy to use as any BLAST-like tool, input a sequence and get results after a few minutes. The results in the KofamKOALA tool are not pretty but they get the job done.
