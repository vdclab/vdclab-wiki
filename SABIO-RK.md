# SABIO-RK

> SABIO-RK is a curated database containing structured information about biochemical reactions and their corresponding kinetics. It describes participants and modifiers of the reactions, as well as measured kinetic data (including kinetic rate equations) embedded in their experimental and environmental context. 
&NewLine;
The system offers standardized data for metabolic and newly also signaling reactions by the use of controlled vocabularies and annotations pointing to other resources and biological ontologies. It enables the access to kinetic data for experimentalists and modellers. Thereby, SABIO-RK facilitates the exchange of the data between experimentalists and modellers, supporting the setup of quantitative computer models.

## Notes from the user
- User can search for reactions by substrate or by enzyme
- Ech reaction has a wealth of data and information like Stochiometric Equations, substrates and products, and EC numbers for enzymes.

## Ease of use
> Overall, the tool is not difficult to use. Searching for reations is "google-like".
