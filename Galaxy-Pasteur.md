# Galaxy @ Pasteur

> Galaxy is a web-based scientific analysis platform used by tens of thousands of scientists across the world to analyze large biomedical datasets such as those found in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and imaging. Started in 2005, Galaxy continues to focus on three key challenges of data-driven biomedical science: making analyses accessible to all researchers, ensuring analyses are completely reproducible, and making it simple to communicate analyses so that they can be reused and extended.

## User Notes
- May be challenging to novice bioinformaticians, users without programming experience
- Familiarity with database queries via command line or computer programming in an object oriented language would benefit all users; learning curve determined by user's computer programming experience
- Tools are highly diverse and flexible; knowledge/familiarity with digital organization and workflows is essential to proper use
- Primarily acts as a within-browser work environment for programmatically manipulating, formatting and analyzing bioinformatic data (e.g., transcriptomics data, proteomics data, etc.)
