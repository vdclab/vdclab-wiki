# Controlled vocabularies to describe protein function 

> EC Numbers. The IUBMB enzyme classification system, available at the IUBMB ExplorEnz website, uses a four-component number (the EC number) that identifies an enzyme in terms of reaction catalysed.

> The Gene Ontology Consortium. The Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase is the worldâ€™s largest source of information on the functions of genes. This knowledge is both human-readable and machine-readable, and is a foundation for computational analysis of large-scale molecular biology and genetics experiments in biomedical research.
