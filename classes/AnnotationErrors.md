# Sources of mistakes in Functional annoations 

> False unknows: Annotated as unknown or general but function is known and published 
- failure in capturing literature  
- Not captured in any database
- Captured in some databases but not others
- Naming problem (inconsistent naming of same entities)
- Failure in progagating to orthologs ( captured for one member of a family but not propagated to others)
>False knowns: Annotated as precise but wrong ( should be general or another annotation) or incomplete 
- Naming problem (inconsistent naming of same entities)
- Fusions (only one of the functional roles is called)
- Multiple functions  (Moonlighting or  Promiscuity only one of the  functional call is called)
- Curation mistake ( the data was incorrectly captured by biocurator)
- Experimental mistake, poor science or finding has been refuted by other studies (the published data  does not make sense or is easily  challenged by an expert , or new data shows it was wrong) 
- Over-annotation of paralogs
