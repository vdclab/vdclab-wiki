# tRNAdb

> tRNAdb 2009, to be updated regularly, provides various services including graphical representations of tRNA secondary structures, a customizable output of aligned or un-aligned sequences with a variety of individual and combinable search criteria, the construction of consensus sequences for any selected set of tRNAs, as well as the illustration of consensus and derived typical cloverleaf structures with features of conservation for any selected set of tRNAs. Furthermore, the implementation of the NCBI taxonomy tree facilitates phylogeny-related queries.

## Notes from the user
- One of the few places to get tRNA sequences from
- Users can browse for specific tRNA sequences or for specific organisms
- tRNA sequences are shown in text format and as a folded molecule
- References are provided for tRNA sequences

## Ease of use

The database is not hard to use but the design is dated and the navigation through the organism list is a little tedious. Otherwise, the database is very helpful.
