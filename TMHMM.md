# TMHMM Server v. 2.0

> This server is for prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins along with a list of the location of the predicted transmembrane helices and the predicted location of the intervening loop regions.

## Notes from the user
- This service can be used to predict transmembrane regions in multiple sequences at once
- The user can decide on how much detail the results contain 

## Ease of use

Inputting proteins is easy and the user can select how detailed the results will be with a few check boxes. The results are clear and even come with a visual representation of where the helices can be.
