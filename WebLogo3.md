# WebLogo 3

> A sequence logo is a graphical representation of an amino acid or nucleic acid multiple sequence alignment and is a useful way to visualize and present consensus sequences. In general, a sequence logo provides a richer and more precise description of, for example, a binding site, than an ordinary consensus sequence would.
