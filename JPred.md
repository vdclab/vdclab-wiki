# JPred 4

> JPred is a web server that takes a protein sequence or multiple alignment of protein sequences, and from these predicts the location of secondary structures using a neural network called Jnet. The prediction classifies each amino acid residue as belonging to alpha helix ('H'), beta sheet ('E') or not H or E ('-') secondary structures.
&NewLine;
JPred also performs predictions of solved accessibility with Jnet and coiled-coil regions via MultiCoil.
