# Database of Essential Genes (DEG)

> Essential genes are those indispensable for the survival of an organism, and therefore are considered a foundation of life. DEG hosts records of currently available essential genomic elements, such as protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs, among bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Essential genes in a bacterium constitute a minimal genome, forming a set of functional modules, which play key roles in the emerging field, synthetic biology.
