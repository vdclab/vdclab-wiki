## Notes from user
- Part of the Sequence Manipulation Suite
- A very basic sequence alignment tool
- The only customizable feature is score weights for gaps in sequences

## Ease of use 
> The tool is easy to use but the output is simply an alignment score and the two query sequences with gaps added by the program.
