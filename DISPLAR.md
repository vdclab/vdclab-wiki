# DISPLAR

> DISPLAR is a neural network method. Given the structure of a protein known to bind DNA, the method predicts residues that contact DNA. The inputs to the neural network include position-specific sequence profiles and solvent accessibilities of each residue and its spatial neighbors. The neural network is trained on known structures of protein-DNA complexes. On our test set, DISPLAR shows prediction accuracy over 80% and coverage of over 60% of actual DNA-contacting residues.
