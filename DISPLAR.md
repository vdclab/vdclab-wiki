## User Notes
- Make take time for processing of request; it is best to perform these kinds of queries (prediction, modeling webservers) in advance of when their results are needed; prepare for any cases of server outages, backlogged queues, etc.
- Provides output via email in a plain text format: predicted likelihood of DNA binding per residue of a provided PDB structure (file or copy-pasted into text box of submission page)
