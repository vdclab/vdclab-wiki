## Website 

- [SIGNOR *Main Page*](https://signor.uniroma2.it/)

## User Notes
- Search and pathway browser is limited to three model organisms (i.e., Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus)
- Database is not comprehensive the few organisms to which it is dedicated (e.g., search of select proteins, even using the UniProt accession as the search term, returns no results); this is likely the result of the level of curation, which is prioritizes by the creators of this resource
 
## Ease of Use
Very straightforward, easy-to-use, but limited in its use due to small organismal scope and deficits in completeness of the database
