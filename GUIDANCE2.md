# The GUIDANCE2 Server

> The GUIDANCE web-server is a powerful and user-friendly tool for assigning a confidence score for each residue, column, and sequence in an alignment and for projecting these scores onto the MSA. The server points to columns and sequences that are unreliably aligned and enables their automatic removal from the MSA, in preparation for downstream analyses.
>
> GUIDANCE is meant to be used for weighting, filtering or masking unreliably aligned positions in sequence alignments before subsequent analysis. GUIADNCE2 also provides a set of alternative alignments which can be used when adopting statistical point of view, i.e. performing statistical analyses that rely on many possible alignments that are supported by the data.
