# BindUP

> BindUP is an automatic server to predict DNA and RNA binding proteins given the three dimensional structure of the protein (or a structural model). The DNA and RNA binding prediction is based on the electrostatic patches on the protein surface and does not rely on either sequence or structural homology. In addition to providing functional prediction (i.e. whether the protein binds nucleic acids or not), the server displays the largest positive and/or negative electrostatic patches on the protein surface, predicted by our Patch Finder algorithm. 
&NewLine;
BindUP holds information for all the protein structures in the RCSB PDB database and is updated every month. The server is applicable in either single or batch mode and can be applied for testing hundreds of proteins simultaneously in a highly efficient manner.

## Notes from Users
- Work better if the structure your protein has already been solved.
- Option to look at the negative and positive patches of the proteins.


## Ease of use
- Enter a PDB id or a PDB file.
- Several proteins can be entered at the same time.
- Run fast.
- Give the largest negative or positive surface of your protein.
