# PlantTFDB

> Based on the family assignment rules, we identified 320,370 transcription factors from 165 species and classified them into 58 families. Species included in PlantTFDB covers the main lineages of green plants, providing genomic TF repertoires across green plants (Summary of TF repertoires in different taxonomic lineages of green plants and the origination stage of TF families).
&NewLine;
To provide comprehensive information for the TF family, a brief introduction and key references are presented for each family. Comprehensive annotations are made for each identified TF, including functional domains, 3D structures, gene ontology (GO), plant ontology (PO), expression information, expert-curated functional description, binding motifs, regulation information, interaction, references, and cross-linsk to various databases such as UniProt, RefSeq, STRING and Entrez Gene.
