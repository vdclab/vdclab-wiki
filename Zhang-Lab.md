# The Yang Zhang Lab

> Web page dedicated to the research, publications, information, and various other aspects of the Zhang Lab at the University of Michigan. One of the main focuses of the Yang Zhang Lab lab is to develop computational methods to predict 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules from amino acid sequence, and to deduce the biological functions based on the sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm. The second focus of the Yang Zhang Lab is to combine computational algorithms and biochemistry experiments to design new protein molecules with enhanced functionality beyond nature proteins. The Yang Zhang Lab is also working on modeling ligand-protein and protein-protein interactions, with particular interest in new drug screening targeting G protein-coupled receptors in the human genome

## Notes from user
- There are many different tools on this website that focus on protein folding and interactions
- Regularly updated and maintained
- Their many online tools are given a breif description in the "online services page"

## Ease of use
> This website offers a wide variety of tools that are specialized for protein related research. Most of them are easy to use and simply require the user to input an amino acid sequence into the query field. Some of the tools also have example inputs that help the user format their data properly.
