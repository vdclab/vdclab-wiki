# Harmonizome

> The Harmonizome is a comprehensive resource of knowledge about genes and proteins, and as such, it enables researchers to discover novel relationships between biological entities, as well as form novel data-driven hypotheses for experimental validation.

## Notes from the user
- Search results range from Dataset, Gene, and gene list
- Datasets are available for download and are separated by biological process
- Good tool for finding annotations for single genes or genes who all participate in a particular function


## Ease of use
> The Harmonizome tool is a streamlined search tool which allows the user to quickly identify genes. Search for genes by name or by function/Gene ontology. Additional Pre-analyzed heatmaps are available for the user to look over for each dataset.
