# meta-PPISP

> meta-PPISP is a meta server for protein-protein interaction site prediction.
meta-PPISP is built on three individual web servers: cons-PPISP, PINUP, and Promate. A linear regression method, using the raw scores of the three severs as input, was trained on a set of 35 nohomologous proteins.
&NewLine;
Cross validation showed that meta-PPISP outperforms all the three individual servers. At coverages indentical to those of the individual methods, the accuracy of meta-PPISP is higher by 4.8 to 18.2 percentage points. Similiar improvements in accuracy are also seen on CAPRI and other targets.
