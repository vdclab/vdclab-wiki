# Phagonaute

> Phagonaute is a Genome Browser that displays the genetic context of a selected gene in parallel to the genetic context of its homologs in other sequenced phage genomes.
>
> In the graphical output produced by Phagonaute, the reference gene as well as its homologs in other genomes are coloured in red and aligned in the center. Homologs of the neighbouring genes are displayed in matching colours to allow easy identification of conserved gene neighbours across genomes.
>
> This tool allows the user to explore remote homologies by varying the probability threshold to declare a match.

## Notes from the user
- Only for phage homologs.
- Make sure to know the gene name of your gene of interest, you can't search by homology.

 
## Ease of use
- Precomputed homology makes the page faster.
- Change parameters of number of genes and cutoff for homology.
- Choose your phage and your gene name, get the genome view of the phage and closely related to your gene of interests.
