# Phagonaute

> Phagonaute is a Genome Browser that displays the genetic context of a selected gene in parallel to the genetic context of its homologs in other sequenced phage genomes.
>
> In the graphical output produced by Phagonaute, the reference gene as well as its homologs in other genomes are coloured in red and aligned in the center. Homologs of the neighbouring genes are displayed in matching colours to allow easy identification of conserved gene neighbours across genomes.
>
> This tool allows the user to explore remote homologies by varying the probability threshold to declare a match.
