# miRPD

> Here we present miRPD in which miRNA-Protein-Disease associations are explicitly inferred. Besides linking miRNAs to diseases, it directly suggests the underlying proteins involved, which can be used to form hypotheses that can be experimentally tested. The inference of miRNAs and diseases is made by coupling known and predicted miRNA-protein associations with protein-disease associations text-mined from the literature. 
&NewLine;
We present scoring schemes that allow us to rank miRNA-disease associations inferred from both curated and predicted miRNA targets by reliability and thereby to create high- and medium-confidence sets of associations.

## User Notes

- There is a Python script available for download (in "Download") and use in command-line. 
 
## Ease of Use

There is no formal help page or tutorial for use and many searches return blank outputs, making use of the tool difficult.
