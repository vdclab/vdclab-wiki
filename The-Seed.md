# The SEED

> The SEED is the product of a cooperative effort between Argonne National Laboratory, The University of Chicago, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Hope College, San Diego State University, The Burnham Institute, and a number of other institutions that focuses on the development of the comparative genomics environment (the SEED) and, more importantly, on the development of curated genomic data. Curation of genomic data is done by an expert annotator across many genomes, via the curation of subsystems. FIGfams are extracted from the curated subsystems, which form the core component of RAST automated annotation.

> May 7, 2020: RAST Annotation server is currently recovering from a storage-server crash (Feb 25, 2020) but anticipates it will be able to recover user jobs/access to jobs.
>
> May 7, 2020: The Metagenomics RAST server (metagenomics.nmpdr.org) is currently unreachable.

## Ease of Use

> Many of the SEED websites and databases are obsolete with dead links and there is an alternative glitch when loading the SEED-viewers securely, making this database relatively difficult to use. 

## User Notes

- Accessing many of the databases is blocked, indicating that they are "unsecure." To overcome this, users can normally change "http://" to "https://" ... Although this was not the case on 5/7/2020 or 5/8/2020 JTB.
- May 8, 2020: Currently, PubSEED appears to be the only easily accessible/usable SEED-Viewer.
