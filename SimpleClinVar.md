# Simple ClinVar

> Simple ClinVar is a web-server application that is able to provide variant, gene, and disease level summary statistics based on the entire ClinVar database in a dynamic and user-friendly web-interface. Overall, our web application is able to interactively answer basic questions regarding genetic variation and its known relationships to disease.

## Notes from the user
 - Great database of diseases and the Genes, Gene variants, and phenotypes associated with them
 - Lots of meta data added to genes which make them easier to search for
 - Limited to only human diseases

 
## Ease of use
> A standard database with an easy to use design and intuitive organization.


## Help
> There is no help section, but the tool is easy enough to use. Keep queries general and you may need to try alternative names for genes.
