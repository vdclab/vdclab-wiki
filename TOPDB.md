# TOPDB

> The Topology Data Bank of Transmembrane Proteins (TOPDB) is currently the most complete and comprehensive collection of transmembrane protein datasets containing experimentally derived topology information. It contains records for 4190 transmembrane proteins with information gathered from the literature and from public databases available on the World Wide Web.

## User Notes
Useful for localization analyses or similar plausibilities; limited only by the resources from which it curates.

## Ease of Use
Relatively easy to use, but requires input of IDs relevant to their database as it is curated.
