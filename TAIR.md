# The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR)

> The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) maintains a database of genetic and molecular biology data for the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana . Data available from TAIR includes the complete genome sequence along with gene structure, gene product information, gene expression, DNA and seed stocks, genome maps, genetic and physical markers, publications, and information about the Arabidopsis research community. Gene product function data is updated every week from the latest published research literature and community data submissions. TAIR also provides extensive linkouts from our data pages to other Arabidopsis resources.

## Notes from User
- Community orientated, keeps track of labs which identified information in A. thaliana such as gene families 
- Database and tools focused on genome/genes, links out to other resources for rest 
- Great tool for protocol searching
