## Notes from the user
 - This database is geared for information about large DNA virus genomes, specifically Mimivirus
 
 
 ## Ease of use
> The website has a collection of databases/tools that specialize in Mimiviruse analysis. Some of the databases/tools are simply a collection of previously analyzed data which the user can browse, and others allow the user to interact with the tool like the BLAST tool.
