# NONCODE

> NONCODE (current version v5.0) is an integrated knowledge database dedicated to non-coding RNAs (excluding tRNAs and rRNAs). Now, there are 17 species in NONCODE(human, mouse, cow, rat, chicken, fruitfly, zebrafish, celegans, yeast, arabidopsis, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, rhesus macaque, opossum platypus and pig). The source of NONCODE includes literature and other public databases.

## Notes from the user
 - Limited to eukaryotic genomes, some searches are limited further to specific organisms. 
 - Results link back to databases where the annotation was taken from
 
 ## Ease of use
 - While the search feature is easy to use, the NONCODE GENE ID names are long strings to numbers and letters that obscure their products. However, the results are intuitive and easy to understand.
