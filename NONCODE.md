## User Notes
- helpful for examining RNA specific data; diverse tool sets available; comparable to databases dedicated to other biological features (genes, proteins)
- Mostly restricted to model/well-studied organisms
- Recommended tools: BLAST, Conservation browser, sequence browser



## Ease of Use
- Very easy to use; similar organization to many common databases/resources
