# tRNAscan-SE

> tRNAscan-SE allows for the searching of tRNA genes in genomic sequence. tRNA scan also compares the tRNA sequence to other tRNA databases for existing matches and predicts secondary structure.

## Notes from the user
- Quickly identifies tRNA sequences from genomic sequences and predicts useful characteristics about tRNA
- Great for identifying new tRNA sequences
- Can be used with multiple tRNA sequences with itemized results for each submitted sequence


## Ease of use
> This tool is very reminiscent of the BLAST tool by NCBI. Just like in BLAST, input a sequence and select which database to search. The results are simple and are easy to navigate through.
