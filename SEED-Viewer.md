# The SEED

> The SEED is the product of a cooperative effort between Argonne National Laboratory, The University of Chicago, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Hope College, San Diego State University, The Burnham Institute, and a number of other institutions that focuses on the development of the comparative genomics environment (the SEED) and, more importantly, on the development of curated genomic data. Curation of genomic data is done by an expert annotator across many genomes, via the curation of subsystems. FIGfams are extracted from the curated subsystems, which form the core component of RAST automated annotation.
>
>The SEED-Viewer allows users to access the latest curated datasets for comparative genomics, annotation, and functional prediction purposes.

## Ease of Use

> The SEED-Viewer is a powerful platform with many capabilities, but is not very intuitive for exploratory use. 
>
> Many of the SEED websites and databases are obsolete with dead links making this database relatively difficult to use.
