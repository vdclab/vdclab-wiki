# Phyletic pattern in MicrobesOnline
> As  part of the MicrobesOnline platform, searches for protein families that follow a specific phylogenetic ditsribution profile can be performed.

## Notes from Users
The genome selector lets you choose which genomes you are interested in. Type the first few letters of the genome name (e.g., "esc" for Escherichia coli) to get a short list of candidates, and then double-click on the ones you want. Your current selection is shown in the middle box.

The genome selector also lets you choose phylogenetic groups of genomes. For example, if you want to search for the presence of a specific capability across the Gammaproteobacteria, type "gamm", double-click on "Gammaproteobacteria", and then type in your keyword at the right. You can search all available genomes by selecting "cellular organisms". Other high-level groups include "Bacteria" and "Archaea".

When your list of genomes is finished push the "Add present" or "Add absent" to set up if you are looking genes that are present or absent from these phyla. 

## Ease of use
The tool is fairly easy to use as long as the genomes you want are in Microbs online. My only complain would be that when you want to add a genome to the present or absent list, you have to reselect all genome because it will juste replace your curent list.
