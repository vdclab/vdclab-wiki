# Protein Ontology

> PRO provides an ontological representation of protein-related entities by explicitly defining them and showing the relationships between them. Each PRO term represents a distinct class of entities (including specific modified forms, orthologous isoforms, and protein complexes) ranging from the taxon-neutral to the taxon-specific (e.g. the entity representing all protein products of the human SMAD2 gene is described in PR:Q15796; one particular human SMAD2 protein form, phosphorylated on the last two serines of a conserved C-terminal SSxS motif is defined by PR:000025934).

## User Notes
- This resource is particularly notable in that it utilizes and maintains entries of protein entities through permalinks (OBO Foundry Permanent URLs); see [the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry GitHub page](https://github.com/OBOFoundry) and the breakdown of this effort, [also on GitHub](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/purl.obolibrary.org/)
- Browse and search features are useful for examining Gene Ontology as it is applied across databases/resources; caution is advised in that it should always be considered how applicable these characterizations are for a specific protein/gene, organism or study system.
 
## Ease of Use
- Updated regularly in a highly transparent fashion
- Use difficulty is dependent upon the familiarity of a user with either gene ontology or protein identifiers/accessions; if more help is needed, see the website's provided wiki resource (linked below)
