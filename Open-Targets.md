# Open Targets Platform

> The Open Targets Platform integrates evidence from genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, drugs, animal models and scientific literature to score and rank target-disease associations for drug target identification. The associations are displayed in an intuitive user interface, and are available through a REST-API and a bulk download. In addition to target-disease associations, the Open Targets Platform also aggregates and displays data at the target and disease levels to aid target prioritisation.
