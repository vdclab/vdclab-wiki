# COXPRESdb

> COXPRESdb is a database providing coexpression information for 11 animal species. One characteristic feature of COXPRESdb is its ability to compare multiple coexpression data derived from different transcriptomics technologies and different species, which strongly reduces false positive relationships in individual gene coexpression data.
