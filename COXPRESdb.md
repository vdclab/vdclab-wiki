# COXPRESdb

> COXPRESdb is a database providing coexpression information for 11 animal species. One characteristic feature of COXPRESdb is its ability to compare multiple coexpression data derived from different transcriptomics technologies and different species, which strongly reduces false positive relationships in individual gene coexpression data.

## Notes from User
- S. pombe gene names are not standard, so diffficult to interpret genes which are coexpressed, can convert Entrez Gene ID to UniProt or PomBase IDs through UniProt mapping 
- Locus page gives network for coexpressed genes and can view organisms with orthologs coexpression network  
- Gives data from r (RNA-seq), m (microarray) and u (union of RNA-seq and microarray) 
- Supportability -a measurement of reliability- explained [here](https://coxpresdb.jp/static/help/supportability/)
