# Protein Structure Initiative (PSI)

> Since 2000, the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) supported the development of new technologies and methods that improve the throughput of protein structure determination. This effort resulted in the deposition of nearly 7000 protein structures to the Protein Data Bank, and the creation of over 20 million homology models over a 15-year period.
