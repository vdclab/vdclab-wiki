# Reference Viral Database (RVDB)

> The Reference Viral Database (RVDB) includes all viral, virus-related, and virus-like nucleotide sequences (excluding bacterial viruses), regardless of length, and with overall reduced cellular sequences. Semantic selection criteria (SEM-I) were used to select viral sequences from GenBank, resulting in a first-generation viral database (VDB).
>
> RVDB contains a broad representation of viral families, sequence diversity, and a reduced cellular content; it includes full-length and partial sequences and endogenous nonretroviral elements, endogenous retroviruses, and retrotransposons.

## Notes from the user
 - This is not so much a tool as it is a reference data set specific to viruses
 - Users can BLAST the Reference Viral Database without downloading the reference data set
 
## Ease of use
> Very easy to use, download and enjoy.
