# Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC)

> **Genome Sequence-Based (Sub-)Species Delineation.**
> The GGDC web service reports digital DDH for a universal and accurate delineation of prokaryotic (sub-)species without inheriting the pitfalls of classic DDH, and also calculates differences in genomic G+C content.
>
> **Genome-Based Phylogeny and Classification of Phages.**
> Advanced comparison of bacterial and archaeal viruses using their genome or proteome sequences. Results include phylogenomic trees with branch support, suggestions for the classification and publication-ready text.
>
> **Inference of Gene Phylogenies and Gene Similarities.**
> Calculate phylogenetic trees and pairwise gene sequence similarities from 16S rRNA or other genes using state-of-the-art methods.
