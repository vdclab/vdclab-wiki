# BioCyc Database Collection

> BioCyc provides access to a collection of 16,822 pathway and genome databases as well as integrated and downloadable software tools. These tools give users the ability to navigate, visualize, and analyze the wealth of information in underlying databases as well as personal omics data. 
>
> Data curated from thousands of publications and integrated from other reputable databases offering information on gene essentiality, regulatory networks, protein features, GO annotations, and more.

## User Notes

- BioCyc has a limited period of free use (users are allotted around 10 queries per month), but full access requires a paid subscription. The subscription fees support curation effots. 
- Users have unlimited access to *Escherichia coli K-12 substr. MG1655* data (via EcoCyc).
- Users should create a BioCyc account (even if just using the free E. coli model), this allows you to save the work you do using the BioCyc tools and access it later.  For example, Smart tables are very useful for gathering data, storing personal experimental data, and linking your known data directly to information of interest very quickly.
- The Omics Dashboard is very useful for analysis of personal user data.  It has many functions available and a guide to help users obtain the results they want (links above in Website section).
- There are many metabolism and metabolic mapping tools available that users should explore. 

## Ease of Use

BioCyc is intuitive and user friendly. BioCyc Tier 1 databases (EcoCyc and MetaCyc) have the general schemes and tools and the websites will automatically interchange when appropriate.
