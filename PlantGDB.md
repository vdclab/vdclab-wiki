# PlantGDB

> The goal of this project is to develop novel, highly automated, scalable, comprehensive, and accurate approaches to genome annotation to address this problem. Project deliverables include:
(1) Software that implements the novel prediction algorithms.
(2) Visualization and data access portals.
(3) A cyberinfrastructure environment implementation of the developed tools for distributed computing, sharing of protocols, and analysis provenance recording.
&NewLine;
In the long run, the project seeks to explore the extent to which genomic biology can transition from a largely descriptive to a highly predictive science driven by quantitative measurements, with algorithms and computation as the domain-adapted language.
