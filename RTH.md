# Center for non-coding RNA in Technology and Health (RTH)

> The Center for Non-coding RNA in Technology and Health (RTH) was established on a grant from the Danish Strategic Research Council (Program Committee for Strategic Growth Technologies). Through a multi-disciplinary collaboration, the Center aims at developing technologies, computational methods as well as experimental approaches for analysis of the mammalian genome for non-coding RNAs with respect to (inflammatory) diseases. The Center will focus on developing these technologies and on diabetes.
