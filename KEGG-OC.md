# KEGG Ortholog Cluster

> KEGG OC (KEGG Ortholog Cluster) is a novel database of ortholog clusters (OCs) based on the whole genome comparison. The OCs were constructed by applying a novel clustering method to all possible protein coding genes in all complete genomes, based on their amino acid sequence similarities. KEGG OC has the following original features in terms of coverage, efficiency, and usability. 
&NewLine;
• First, it consists of all fully sequenced genomes of a wide range of organisms from three domains (eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea). 
• Second, it is computationally efficient to calculate OCs, which makes it possible to regularly update the contents. 
• Third, it is compatible with the KEGG database, which provides an easy way to link the OCs with KEGG PATHWAY, BRITE functional hierarchies, KEGG MODULE, KEGG MEDICUS, and many more.
