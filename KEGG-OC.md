# KEGG Ortholog Cluster

> KEGG OC (KEGG Ortholog Cluster) is a database of ortholog clusters (OCs) based on the whole genome comparison. The OCs were constructed by applying a novel clustering method to all possible protein coding genes in all complete genomes, based on their amino acid sequence similarities. KEGG OC has the following original features in terms of coverage, efficiency, and usability. 
&NewLine;
• First, it consists of all fully sequenced genomes of a wide range of organisms from three domains (eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea). 
• Second, it is computationally efficient to calculate OCs, which makes it possible to regularly update the contents. 
• Third, it is compatible with the KEGG database, which provides an easy way to link the OCs with KEGG PATHWAY, BRITE functional hierarchies, KEGG MODULE, KEGG MEDICUS, and many more.

## Notes from Users
Group of orthologs done on completely sequenced genomes. You will get a list of KEGG proteins entries and a distribution in the tree of life of the family. Once you identified your family, you are linked to other KEGG tools. 

> You cannot extract the sequences from here.

## Ease of use
Enter the name or id of protein and get your results.  You can also serach by using the sequence of your protein as an entry. For a KEGG tool/database it is somewhat easy to use.
