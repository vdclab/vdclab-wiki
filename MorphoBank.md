# MorphoBank
> MorphoBank provides a digital archive of those data so that the observations can be shared in both words and pictures with future scientists and the public.
&NewLine;
In particular, MorphoBank assists scientists building the Tree of Life - the genealogy of all living and extinct species. In this endeavor scientists must collect data on all heritable features - both genotypes (e.g., DNA sequences) and phenotypes (e.g., anatomy, behavior, physiology). 
&NewLine;
MorphoBank is part of the new and growing cyberinfrastructure for phenotypes to house, save and share information on anatomy, physiology, behavior and other features of species.
