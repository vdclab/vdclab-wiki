# BioReader

> BioReader is a tool that enables users to perform classification of scientific literature by text mining-based classification of article abstracts.  
>
> BioReader supports data and information collection by implementing text mining-based classification of primary biomedical literature in a web interface, thus enabling curators and researchers to take advantage of the vast amounts of data and information in the published literature. BioReader outperforms existing tools with similar functionalities and expands the features used for mining literature in database curation efforts.

 ## Notes from the user
 - Uses a computer algorithm to identify articles containing common "relevant" words from a list of user specified "relevant" articles 
 - User must supply lists of articles (20 minimum) to help the algorithm determine article relevance and discriminating terms
 - Results are given as lists of articles grouped in classes with performance metrics and PCoA plots to show how the algorithm scored the articles
 
 ## Ease of use
 > This is a very niche tool that can help guide the user through reading large amounts of articles. There is a lot of material to help the user understand how to use the tool and how to understand the results. However, the user needs to have lists of articles with discriminating terms that they have already read and determined to be "relevant" and "not relevant" before they can use the tool.
