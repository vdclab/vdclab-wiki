# ConsensusPathDB

> ConsensusPathDB-human integrates interaction networks in Homo sapiens including binary and complex protein-protein, genetic, metabolic, signaling, gene regulatory and drug-target interactions, as well as biochemical pathways. Data originate from currently 32 public resources for interactions and interactions that we have curated from the literature. The interaction data are integrated in a complementary manner (avoiding redundancies), resulting in a seamless interaction network containing different types of interactions.

## Website

- [ConsensusPathDB *Main Page*](http://cpdb.molgen.mpg.de/)
{.links-list}


## Notes from user
- Large number of integrated databses for interaction data
- Easily creat maps of annotated interactions between proteins and gene with links to sources of annotations
- Also display ligands with the proteins they interact with


## Ease of use
-  Search for pathways for protien interactiosn by gene name or by pathway name (like glycolysis). This tool quickly gives the user a list of known pathways and genes that the user can select to futher explore as visualized pathways.
