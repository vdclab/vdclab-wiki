# What is Bioinformatics?

Bioinformatics, broadly, is a subfield of biology defined by the use of interdisciplinary technological approaches to extract information from biological data and to formulate biological knowledge and understanding from those observations. In 1970, Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper defined bioinformatics as "the study of information processes in biotic systems" (PMID: 14630646), but, with the advancements of computing, the field of bioinformatics has seen colossal changes since those early days.

Because this field is so diverse and is built on the motivation of finding practical data solutions, often computational ones, the strategies used by those who practice bioinformatics can look very different between different backgrounds of training, with some bioinformaticians preferring tool-making and others preferring a combined approach of leveraging bioinformatic tools for pairings of *in silico* and *in vivo* functional genomics.
