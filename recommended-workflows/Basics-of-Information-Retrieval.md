# What is Bioinformatics?

Bioinformatics is a subfield of biology defined by the interdisciplinary approaches necessary to extract information from biological data and to formulate biological knowledge and understanding from these observations.

Because this field is so diverse and is built on practical data solutions, the strategies used by those who practice bioinformatics can look very different between different backgrounds of training, with some bioinformaticians preferring tool-making and others leveraging bioinformatic tools for combined *in silico* and *in vivo* functional genomics.
