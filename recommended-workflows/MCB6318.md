# MCB6318 - Comparative Microbial Genomics
### Module 0 - Start Here
Put whatever you want here to introduce the course material, but I feel like a list of resources, etc., would be redundant.

### Module 1 - Dealing with the Avalanche of Genomic Data
(insert diagram of workflow)
**Objective Summary**
- Extract and analyze bacterial genomes of interest 
- Extract sets of proteins/genes sequences of a specific family
- Find the literature associated with a protein family
- Map accession numbers from one database to another
- Reformat Fasta files using REGEX  tools


#### Extracting and Analyzing Bacterial Genomes

> Type of genomes, genome quality will vary per source. Some sources are better for some taxa than others. These and other factors are important when selecting a resource or multiple resources from which to extract genomes. Additionally, the total number of genomes being used should also be considered.

**[BV_BRC](/databases/bacterial_databases/patric)**
**IMG/JGI[Genome-Portal](/databases/general_databases/Genome-Portal)**
**NCBI Genome**
**MicroScope (GenoScope)**



#### Extracting Sets of Protein/Gene Sequences for a Target Family

**UniProt**
**NCBI Protein**
**NCBI Gene**

#### Finding Literature Pertaining to a Target Protein Family
(see broader [Literature Capture Workflow](link))

#### Mapping Accessions/Identifiers Between Different Source Databases

[**DAVID**](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/conversion.jsp)
[**UniProt Mapper**](https://www.uniprot.org/id-mapping)
(other mappers)

#### Reformatting FASTA Files Using REGEX Tools
> Registration of a RegExr user account is optimal, as this allows for saving and reuse of script templates to transform or convert different types of sequence headers. Resource also includes a reference and instructional materials for text expression rules, practices.
