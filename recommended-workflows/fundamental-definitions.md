# Fundamental Definitions
## Homology and Orthology
Bioinformatics, as a field of methods, is often highly dependent upon similarity-based comparisons of biomolecular sequences. Before one can proceed to structure or function, characteristics of the sequence must first be considered.


**Homology**

**Orthology**

**Paralogy**


> CAUTION: paralogs pose a threat to accurate annotation transfer between homologs. Therefore, it is important to investigate putative functional subgroups within a protein family prior to committing to a functional annotation assignment.
