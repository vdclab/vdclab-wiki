# Fundamental Definitions
## Homology and Orthology
Methods implemented in bioinformatics are often highly dependent upon ***similarity-based comparisons of biomolecular sequences***. Before one can proceed to structure or function, characteristics of the sequence must first be analyzed.
High sequence similarity is used ***to infer homology*** (i.e., that the given sequences share a common ancestral sequence).
An inference of homology can then be used ***to infer orthology*** (i.e., in terms of their relation, sequences are inferred to be a result of a speciation event, and, therefore, likely share the same function).

**Orthology**

**Paralogy**


> CAUTION: paralogs pose a threat to accurate annotation transfer between homologs. Therefore, it is important to investigate putative functional subgroups within a protein family prior to committing to a functional annotation assignment.
