# XSuLT

> XSuLT is used to annotate an alignment with structural information in the form of formatting styles. XSuLT is an enhancement on JOY based on XSLT that allows the display of additional information such as interactions, predictions, RMSD and entropy. All the annotated information is contained in an XML file called "XTEML", which can be displayed in HTML format in your browser.
