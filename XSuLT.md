# XSuLT

> XSuLT is a tool for the annotation and formatting of a multiple protein sequence alignment or single structure. It is used to annotate sequence alignments with three-dimensional (3D) structural information in order to assist in the comparative analysis of protein evolution and in the optimisation of alignments for comparative modelling and construct design. XSuLT is an enhancement on JOY based on Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) that allows the display of additional information such as interactions, predictions, RMSD and entropy. All the annotated information is contained in an XML file called "XTEML", which can be displayed in HTML format in your browser.

## Ease of Use

> Job submission is fairly self-explanatory, but users should check the help page for any key points that may pertain to their job.

## User Notes

- It is recommended that users use this tool in a Chrome browser.
- If users run into issues or are unable to submit a job after using the help page tutorial, they should send the developers a message by clicking on the "Problem?" button at the bottom of the page. 
- Annotating an entry as 'structureM' will mark it as both sequence AND structure, allowing the combined use of secondary structure prediction and analysis, which can be useful for the assessment of predicted models.
