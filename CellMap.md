# The Cell Map

> Providing access to quantitative genomic data is key to ensure large-scale data validation and promote new discoveries. The Cell Map serves as the central repository for quantitative genetic interaction data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae produced by systematic Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) experiments in the Boone and Andrews labs and provides a set of fundamental tools for analyzing genetic interaction data. In particular, we allow users to easily visualize, explore and functionally annotate genetic interactions as well as extract and re-organize sub-networks using data-driven or annotation-driven network layouts in an intuitive and interactive manner.
