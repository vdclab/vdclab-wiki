# NDEx - Network Data Exchange
> The NDEx Project provides an open-source framework where scientists and organizations can share, store, manipulate, and publish biological network knowledge. The NDEx Project maintains a free, public website; alternatively, users can also decide to run their own copies of the NDEx Server software in cases where the stored networks must be kept in a highly secure environment (such as for HIPAA compliance) or where high application load is incompatible with a shared public resource.

## Website
- [NDEx *Network Data Exchange Home Page*](https://home.ndexbio.org/index/)
{.links-list}

## User Notes
- Allows for analyses of list of genes/proteins on landing page
- Allows for in-browser visualization and data export of networks
- Limited only by the number of networks curated by the site

## Ease of Use
- May require some awareness or familiarity of networks and data formats in order to more easily navigate the results page upon a query
- Relatively easy-to-use if comfortable with conventions common in naming proteins/genes, GO terms or pathways; surprisingly quick loading speeds, despite amounts of data to be reviewed (true for visualizations and query results)
