# NDEx - Network Data Exchange
> The NDEx Project provides an open-source framework where scientists and organizations can share, store, manipulate, and publish biological network knowledge. The NDEx Project maintains a free, public website; alternatively, users can also decide to run their own copies of the NDEx Server software in cases where the stored networks must be kept in a highly secure environment (such as for HIPAA compliance) or where high application load is incompatible with a shared public resource.
