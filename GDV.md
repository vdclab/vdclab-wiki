# The NCBI Genome Data Viewer (GDV)

> The NCBI Genome Data Viewer (GDV) is a genome browser supporting the exploration and analysis of eukaryotic RefSeq genome assemblies. Users can use GDV to visualize different types of sequence-associated data in a genomic context. Genome Data Viewer is also used by different NCBI resources, such as GEO and dbGaP, to display datasets associated with specified experiments or samples in a genome browser context.
