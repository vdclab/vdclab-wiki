# EMBL-EBI MetaboLights

> MetaboLights is a database for Metabolomics experiments and derived information. The database is cross-species, cross-technique and covers metabolite structures and their reference spectra as well as their biological roles, locations and concentrations, and experimental data from metabolic experiments. MetaboLights is the recommended Metabolomics repository for a number of leading journals.
&NewLine;
MetaboLights offers user-submission tools and has strong reporting capabilities. MetaboLights uses and further develops de-facto standard formats where various components are encapsulated, such as the encoded spectral and chromatographic data, and associated information about the chemical structure, as well as metadata describing assays and the study as a whole.
&NewLine;
MetaboLights semantic quality is based on various controlled vocabularies and ontologies linking data to existing resources such as BRENDA.
