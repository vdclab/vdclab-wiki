# MolScript v2.1

> MolScript is a program that generates plots of protein structures and allows several kinds of representations, including the basic wire-drawing, ball-and stick and CPK models. An important feature of the software is the atom and residue selection mechanism allowing to give a set of atoms or residues as argument to a command that produces graphical objects. MolScript can also be used for making plots of non-protein structures.
