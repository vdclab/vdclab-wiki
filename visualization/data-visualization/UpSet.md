# UpSet

> UpSet is a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries.

 ## Notes from User
 - Effective tool for visualizing intersecting sets
 - Complex visual, takes time to understand graphics and options of way to visualize data
 	- Gives easy to understand example of Simpsons to start with
- Can also use in R
