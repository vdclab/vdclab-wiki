## Notes from the user
- This service uses the Google maps API to control several different views of a selected bacterial genome
- The user can search for a gene or blast a submitted sequence to locate where on the genome that gene or sequence are located
- The pathway map is also a nice reference if exploring metabolic pathways


## Ease of use

This tool is easy to use, especially if you are already familiar with google maps. Simply select a genome, which view you want to see, and explore the genome with ease.
