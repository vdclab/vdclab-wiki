# ETE Toolkit

> The Python Environment for tree exploration is a python framework available for the user to download and use for the analysis and visualization of trees. Additionally, there are instructions for phylogenetic tools within the the environment available for the user to further analyze their trees.

## Website

- [ETE Toolkit *Main Page*](http://etetoolkit.org/)
- [ETE Treeview *Webserver to visualize tree*](http://treeview.etetoolkit.org/static/upload_tree.html)

## Notes from the user

- Have a webserver tool for those who don't want to use the command line version
- Will require knowledge of python and how to install the environment
- A programmable tree with complete control over how the tree is visualized
- Nice  "Tree Viewer" tool that allows the user to view a tree next to a sequence alignment

## Ease of use

The python environment is a harder tool to use than other online options but offers more control of the tree and what information is displayed.
