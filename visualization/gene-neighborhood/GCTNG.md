## Notes from Users
- Lots of input type.
- Lots of output type.
- Color the arrow in based on COG, PFAM or KEGG.

## Ease of use
- Input an ID or a gene name (Easiest I have seen).
- On the next page choose the genomes to display.
- Results colored by gene functions.
- Gene function listed on the side and clickable (linked to the related database).
- Database changeable after the result is given.
- Result downloadable in multiple format (sequence, id, tree, images).
