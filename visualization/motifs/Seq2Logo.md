# Seq2Logo

> Seq2Logo is a web-based sequence logo generation method for construction and visualization of amino acid binding motifs and sequence profiles including sequence weighting, pseudo counts and two-sided representation of amino acid enrichment and depletion.

 ## Notes from the user
 
 - Great for analyzing aligned amino acid sequences as a whole for shared motifs
 - Unlike other tools, Seq2Logo needs only an alignment to generate the whole sequence logo for the query sequences
 
 ## Ease of use

Very standard alignment uploading process and lots of ways to customize the analysis (Logo type, clustering method, weight for alignment score, etc...). The resulting logo is easily exported as a PNG.
