# SymbolHound

> SymbolHound is a search engine for special characters. Unlike other search engines, which treat non-alphanumeric symbols such as * or & as boolean operators, or ignore symbols like @ or \ altogether, SymbolHound actually searches the internet for these characters. That means that when you do a web search for the character #, you actually get results with the character # in them. This can be important for programmers who actually need to find out what a symbol means, or find example code or tutorials with that character.
