# 3DComplex

> 3D Complex is a hierarchical classification of protein complexes that describes similarities in structure, sequence, as well as topology of contacts of the constituent proteins. This is the first automatic method for generating non-redundant sets of complexes, which can be used to derive unbiased statistics on their structure and evolution.
