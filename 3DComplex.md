# 3DComplex

> 3D Complex is a hierarchical classification of protein complexes that describes similarities in structure, sequence, as well as topology of contacts of the constituent proteins. This is the first automatic method for generating non-redundant sets of complexes, which can be used to derive unbiased statistics on their structure and evolution.

## User Notes
Useful tool for examining configurations of protein complexes for which contributing protein structures are published and readily available. Similarly to most tools of this kind, the usefulness and accuracy of this site is largely dependent upon the resources from which it curates and synthesizes information; that is, this resource is limited by what can be sourced and examined from data available through PDB, it's primary data source.
 
## Ease of Use
Difficult to use for those with novice familiarity with quaternary protein structures and macromolecular complex configurations, largely due to the options/drop-downs necessary to perform queries. For less-experienced users, it is recommended that the Browser be used instead of the Search tool for best results. Note that "QS" is an acronym used to stand for "quaternary structure" (this term and acronym are only connected upon indirect reference through definition of a related term in a subsection of the "About" page called "The PDB Biological Subunit").
