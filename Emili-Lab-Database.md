# Emili Lab Databases & Links

> The Emili Lab is a driving force behind The Center for Network Systems Biology (CNSB) at Boston University.  The overarching goal of CNSB is to describe the physical and functional interactions of cellular biomolecules that mediate the diverse complex biological processes crucial to human health and disease. 
>
> The Emili group is pioneering the field of "interactome" science, using functional proteomics, protein mass spectrometry, and network biology to explore the interactions of cellular proteins allowing for formation of complex multiprotein cellular machinery in organisms from <i>E. coli</i> to humans.
>
> From the Emili Lab Databases and Links page, users can find dedicated websites and tools for exploring proteomes of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, Mouse, <i>E. coli</i>, Human, and Metazoan complexes.

## User Notes
- Links to BioGRID and PRIDE data from each sitation can be found at the Emili Lab Databases and Links main page.
- Not all of the PubMed citation links on the Emili Lab page are correct; Links in citiations (below) will take you to the relevant pubmed abstracts. 
- Some of the websites have data that is available for searching and downloading, while others have a variety of user exploratory tools. Websites containing user tools are provided below. 
- The designated websites are generally functional, although broken/non-functional links can be found in several instances. 
- There is a website providing "Human Soluble Protein Conplexes" data, but the site is inaccessible without advanced permission. 
- There is currently no data in the "E. coli proteome - Membrane proteins" website, as it is pending submission. 
- The "E. coli proteome - eMaps - Cell Envelope" site maps genetic interactions and reveals functional crosstalk between cell envelope biosynthesis pathways. It also has a tool for viewing condition-dependent enrichment of these pathways in relation to each other. 
- The "Metazoan complexes" website also contains data from Humans, Mice, Drosophila, C. elegans, Sea urchins.  This site is very up-to-date and includes tools to explore conservation and projected protein-protein interactions across more than 100 eukaryotic species. 

## Ease of Use
- The Main Emili database page is straight forward and easy to use.  The Emili site has links to 14 designated webpages for exploring data based on factors like organisms, tissue type, global protein landscape, and/or complexes found in specific sublocations.
- The design of the data-specific webpages is not uniform, so depending on your species or purpose the ease of use is variable. 
- The Project Databases link specific publications to the respective data, found in PRIDE and/or BioGRID databases.
