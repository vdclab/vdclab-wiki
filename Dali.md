# The Dali Server

> The Dali server is a network service for comparing protein structures in 3D. You submit the coordinates of a query protein structure and Dali compares them against those in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). In favourable cases, comparing 3D structures may reveal biologically interesting similarities that are not detectable by comparing sequences.
