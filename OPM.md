# Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OPM)

> The Orientations of Proteins in Membranes (OPM) database provides a collection of transmembrane, monotopic and peripheral proteins from the Protein Data Bank whose spatial arrangements in the lipid bilayer have been calculated theoretically and compared with experimental data. 
>
> The database allows analysis, sorting and searching of membrane proteins based on their structural classification, species, destination membrane, numbers of transmembrane segments and subunits, numbers of secondary structures and the calculated hydrophobic thickness or tilt angle with respect to the bilayer normal. All coordinate files with the calculated membrane boundaries are available for downloading.

## Notes from the user
Useful for troubleshooting subcellular localization and functional associations of protein family members; similar to other resources of this type, the site's usefulness and accuracy are reflections of the databases from which it curates and synthesizes information.

 
## Ease of use
Straightforward, easy to navigate website and resources; may require some knowledge of or familiarity with protein families.
