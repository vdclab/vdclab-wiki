# VIZBI Blog

> Visualisation is increasingly important in life science as data grows rapidly in volume and complexity. The VIZBI initiative is an international conference series bringing together researchers developing and using computational visualisation to address a broad range of biological research areas; the conference also attracts participation from medical illustrators, graphic designers, and graphic artists. VIZBI is held annually, alternating between Europe and the USA.
