# BacDive

> The Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase BacDive is the worldwide largest database for standardized bacterial phenotypic information. Its mission is to mobilize research data on strain level from internal files in culture collections (e.g. CABI, CIP, CCUG, DSMZ) as well as from primary literature and make it freely accessible. 
>
>	Today BacDive offers data on 81,827 bacterial and archaeal strains, including 14,091 type strains and thereby covers approx. 90% of the validly described species. Within over 600 data fields the topics taxonomy, morphology, physiology, origin, molecular data, and cultivation conditions are covered. The database offers systematic access to phenotypic data.
