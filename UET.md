# Universal Evolutionary Trace (UET)

> The UET (Universal Evolutionary Trace) database offers pre-computed ET analyses for the protein structure databank, and on-the-fly analysis of any UNIPROT or amino acid sequence in FASTA format. Additionally, ET results map to a structure through a JSmol display to identify functionally important regions.

## Notes from User
- Computed relatively quickly 
- Colors on structure and histogram representing more to less important are not visually appealing
- Can add a plug-in to PyMOL which could be useful if wanting to use/manipulate data computed by UET
