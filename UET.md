# Universal Evolutionary Trace (UET)

> The UET (Universal Evolutionary Trace) database offers pre-computed ET analyses for the protein structure databank, and on-the-fly analysis of any UNIPROT or amino acid sequence in FASTA format. Additionally, ET results map to a structure through a JSmol display to identify functionally important regions.
