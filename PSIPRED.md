# Predict Secondary Structure (PSIPRED)

> PSIPRED is a  simple and accurate secondary structure prediction method, incorporating two feed-forward neural networks which perform an analysis on output obtained from PSI-BLAST (Position Specific Iterated - BLAST). Using a very stringent cross validation method to evaluate the method's performance, PSIPRED 3.2 achieves an average Q3 score of 81.6%.

 ## Notes from the user
 
- Great visualization of amino acid allocation in secondary structures
- Color coded results and exports of results
 
 ## Ease of use

The PSIPRED service can be used on protein databank identifiers or with fasta sequences. This makes uploading query proteins easy and the results are easy to look at and understand.
