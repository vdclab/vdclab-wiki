# Predict Secondary Structure (PSIPRED)

> PSIPRED is a  simple and accurate secondary structure prediction method, incorporating two feed-forward neural networks which perform an analysis on output obtained from PSI-BLAST (Position Specific Iterated - BLAST). Using a very stringent cross validation method to evaluate the method's performance, PSIPRED 3.2 achieves an average Q3 score of 81.6%.
