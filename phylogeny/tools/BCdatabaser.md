## Notes from the user

- Results are Zip files with lists of Fasta sequences of genome fragments that the user specified
- Results are shared with all users and available for download by anyone

## Ease of use

This is not an easy tool to use, it took some time to even get the example sets to work. Users can download the tool for offline use and to modify.

## Help

There are some practice data sets that can help familiarize the user with the tool but it will require some effort to understand it.
