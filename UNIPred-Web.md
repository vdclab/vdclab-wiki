# UNIPred Web

> UNIPred (unbalance-aware network integration and prediction of protein functions), an algorithm that properly combines different biomolecular networks and predicts protein functions using parametric semisupervised neural models. The algorithm explicitly takes into account the unbalance between unannotated and annotated proteins both to construct the integrated network and to predict protein annotations for each functional class.
>
> UNIPred-Web, a user-friendly Web tool for the application of the UNIPred algorithm to a variety of biomolecular networks, already supplied by the system, and for the visualization and exploration of protein networks. We support different organisms and different types of networks â€”e.g., co-expression, shared domains and physical interaction networks. Users are supported in the different phases of the process, ranging from the selection of the networks and the protein function to be predicted, to the navigation of the integrated network. The system also supports the upload of user-defined protein networks.

 ## Notes from the user
 - Lots of data is available to create networks for related genes
 - Integrates Genetic interactions, STRING database interactions, Shared protein domains, and co-expression data to form its networks
 - Limited to model organisms
 
 ## Ease of use

Making networks is easy, just select the types of data desired for the analysis and your email and the completed job ID is sent to you when the job is done. Navigation is simple and the resulting nodes are easy to move and explore. To see your data, you need to specify a "node" or gene that the network will be built around.
