# MicrobesOnline

> MicrobesOnline provides a community resource for comparative and functional genome analysis. The portal includes over 1000 complete genomes of bacteria, archaea and fungi, thousands of expression microarrays from diverse organisms, and fitness data for 4 organisms with over 2,000 comparisons. 
>
>To assist in annotating genes and in reconstructing their evolutionary history, MicrobesOnline includes a comparative genome browser based on phylogenetic trees for every gene family as well as a species tree. To identify co-regulated genes, MicrobesOnline can search for genes based on their expression profile, and provides tools for identifying regulatory motifs and seeing if they are conserved. 
>
>MicrobesOnline also includes fast phylogenetic profile searches, comparative views of metabolic pathways, operon predictions, a workbench for sequence analysis and integration with RegTransBase and other microbial genome resources, including Genome-Linked Application for Metabolic Maps (GLAMM) - a unified web interface for visualizing metabolic networks, reconstructing metabolic networks from annotated genome data, visualizing experimental data in the context of metabolic networks and investigating the construction of novel, transgenic pathways.

## Ease of Use

> The site is somewhat "clunky" looking and outdated with several obsolete/dead links, making it hard to use for exploratory purposes.
> However, there is a very intensive site guide including tips/warngings (link below) that should allow you to easily use any feature of the site.

## User Notes

- Registered users are able to add annotations. 
- You can access and download full genome information (including tRNA, rRNA and CRISPR/CRISPR spacer sequences and Pseudogene sequences derived from either RNA or protein-coding genes)
- The database indexes genes by VIMSS gene IDs.
- Performing a gene search gives you access to a huge amount of relevant information.
