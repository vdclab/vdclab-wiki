# GenomeNet

> GenomeNet is a Japanese network of database and computational services for genome research and related research areas in biomedical sciences, operated by the Kyoto University Bioinformatics Center.
>
>GenomeNet data is retrieved, related and crossreferenced by DBGET, and internal data retrieval system. DBGET retrieves data from all KEGG databases, NCBI, ExPASy/EBI, EMBL, RCSB, and others (including searchable websites) resulting in highly comprehensive and informative output.
>
> GenomeNet was established in September 1991 under the Human Genome Program of the then Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (Monbusho). The GenomeNet service has been developed by the Kanehisa Laboratory in Kyoto University as part of the research projects. See the archive of the Kanehisa Laboratory.
