# GenomeNet

> GenomeNet is a Japanese network of database and computational services for genome research and related research areas in biomedical sciences, operated by the Kyoto University Bioinformatics Center.
>
>GenomeNet data is retrieved, related and crossreferenced by DBGET, and internal data retrieval system. DBGET retrieves data from all KEGG databases, NCBI, ExPASy/EBI, EMBL, RCSB, and others (including searchable websites) resulting in highly comprehensive and informative output.
>
> GenomeNet also provides Bioinformatics tools for sequence, genome, and chemical analysis.

## User Notes
- The GenomeNet service has been developed by the Kanehisa Laboratory in Kyoto University as part of the research projects. See the archive of the Kanehisa Laboratory. 
- This is part of the KEGG network of sites/tools, as always useful but often cryptic, you have to explore to discover the cool tools.
