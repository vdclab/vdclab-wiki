# Tree of Life Web Project - Life on Earth

> The Tree of Life Web Project is a collection of information about biodiversity compiled collaboratively by hundreds of expert and amateur contributors. Its goal is to contain a page with pictures, text, and other information for every species and for each group of organisms, living or extinct. Connections between Tree of Life web pages follow phylogenetic branching patterns between groups of organisms, so visitors can browse the hierarchy of life and learn about phylogeny and evolution as well as the characteristics of individual groups.

>  From developers: "Please keep in mind that the Tree of Life website is still very much under construction. We are continuously adding new pages, but some important branches are still missing"

## Website 

- [ToLWeb Life on Earth *Main Page*](http://tolweb.org/Life_on_Earth/1)

## User Notes

- Users must contact the copyright owner prior to using any images from the site for any purpose other than personal notes. 
- There is a table provided for each branch of exploration (at the right side of every page) that changes and is relevant to the imformation currently on the page. Users can also change the setting options of the pages they explore, using this table.
- Most of the available branches are for Eukaryotes.  Escherichia coli (or any gamma Proteobacteria) is not yet available and the page was last updated in 2006.
- Some pages have a lot of information provided, while others have none. 
- Many pages have images and videos for members of the branch being explored. 

## Ease of Use

The website is well designed and easy to use, but is missing branches/information for a large portion of the tree of life. This site is useful for learning about the tree of life or if the Users organism of interest is present in the current tree.
