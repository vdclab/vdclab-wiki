# PHAge Search Tool Enhanced Release (PHASTER)

> PHAge Search Tool (PHAST) is a web server designed to rapidly and accurately identify, annotate and graphically display prophage sequences within bacterial genomes or plasmids. It accepts either raw DNA sequence data or partially annotated GenBank formatted data and rapidly performs a number of database comparisons as well as phage 'cornerstone' feature identification steps to locate, annotate and display prophage sequences and prophage features.
>
> PHAST also generates downloadable, high quality, interactive graphics that display all identified prophage components in both circular and linear genomic views.
