# Ensembl

> Ensembl is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. Ensembl annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data. Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species.

## Ease of Use

- The website is not immediately intuitive, but has an extensive help page. 

## User Notes

- The FAC page has helpful information for navigating the site and interpreting data. 
- The Ensembl Tools tab has tools for predicting variants, searching genomes, ID conversion, and analysis of GWAS summary statistics. 
- Users can upload their personal data to display in Ensembl. Data formatting and display tips can be found in the "Add a custom track" pop-up window.
- Ensemble has sister sites that focus on Bacteria, Fungi, Plants, Protists, and Metazoa rather than Eukaryota.  Links to these sites can be found at the bottom of the home page.
