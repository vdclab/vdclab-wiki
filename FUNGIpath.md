# FUNGIpath

> FUNGIpath predicts groups of orthologous proteins in fungal genomes with the MaRiO pipeline. Orthology groups are annotated with the FUNGIpath annotation pipeline based on Swiss-Prot and MetaCyc data. Functional annotations of groups allows an easy comparison of the metabolism within species represented in the associated database.
&NewLine;
There are 165 species for which data are currently available in FUNGIpath (v.4.0 - May 2014).

## User Notes

 Pathways (KEGG and MetaCyc) can be explored to determine the presence/absense of each pathway enzyme among the database genomes as well as percent coverage by phylum, subphylum and class.  

Users can search for orthologous proteins and upload fasta-formatted fungal genomes for annotation.

Users can tailor searches to allow, include, or exclude select species genomes.
