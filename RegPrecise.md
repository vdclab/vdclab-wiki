# RegPrecise

> The RegPrecise is a database for capturing, visualization and analysis of transcription factor regulons that were reconstructed by the comparative genomic approach.
&NewLine;
The primary object of the database is a single regulon in a particular genome, which is described by the identified transcription factor (TF), its DNA binding site model (a profile), as well as the set of regulated genes, operons and associated transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs).
&NewLine;
The key idea of comparative genomics approach is that the analysis of regulons of a particular TF should be carried out in several genomes simultaneously. Therefore RegPrecise provides a special object of the higher hierarchy - regulog, which represents a collection of regulons of the same TF inferred in a set of closely related genomes.

## Notes from Users
- updated frequently
- strong database of manually curated regulons
- different way to access the data
- only bacteria

## Ease of use
- very easy if you know what you are looking for.
- may be a pain for exploratory purposes
