# BioGPS

> BioGPS is a gene portal built with two guiding principles in mind -- customizability and extensibility. 
&NewLine;
BioGPS offers a customizable gene report layout, where you can control which pieces of data are displayed and how they're displayed. Select from our extensive plugin library only the sources that are relevant to you.
&NewLine;
We designed BioGPS by creating a simple plugin interface which allows anyone to add new plugins to BioGPS, completely autonomously. Our goal is to completely remove ourselves from the critical path of extending BioGPS. With other portals, you can beg and plead with the portal administrators to add new content. In BioGPS, if you see data that's missing (or have data that others would be interested in), you can do it all yourself. (Note that we're still finalizing this plugin architecture, so stay tuned!)
&NewLine;
BioGPS is clearly a work in progress, but we think we've got a framework that's here to stay. Let us know if you've got suggestions, but otherwise, just dig in!

## Notes from user
- This database is limited to mamalian gene annotation
- Pluggins are available to search multiple databases at once and display their results in one page.
- 

## Ease of use
> This tool stands above most annotation tools by seemlessly tieing multiple databases into 1 location. Each pluggin I tested worked perfectly and the presentation of the data was a great middle ground between cluttered and simplistic.
