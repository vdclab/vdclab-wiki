# Proteomics Identifications & Quantitations Data Management & Integration Service (PIQMIe)

> PIQMIe is a web-based tool for reliable analysis and visualization of semi-quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data. PIQMIe readily integrates peptide and (non-redundant) protein identifications and quantitations from multiple experiments with additional biological information on the protein entries, and makes the linked data available in the form of a light-weight relational database, which enables dedicated data analyses (e.g. in R) and user-driven queries. 
&NewLine;
Using the web interface, users are presented with a concise summary of their proteomics experiments in numerical and graphical forms, as well as with a searchable protein grid and interactive visualization tools to aid in the rapid assessment of the experiments and in the identification of proteins of interest.
