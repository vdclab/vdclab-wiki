# Recommended Bioinformatic Workflows
The following modules of workflows have been organized by the structure employed in the UF Fundamentals of Bioinformatics course (ca. Fall semester 2022). That is, each module contains tools related to a single overarching objective informed by those of the official modules. 

> It is important to note that, while it is the goal to capture all tools covered in each course module, this list is *not guaranteed* to be comprehensive. Therefore, students should make note of any differences between the module content of this resource and that of the official course material. Moreover, while these workflows should progress similarly to those in the official course, they somewhat diverge in numbering.
