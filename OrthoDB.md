# OrthoDB

> OrthoDB presents a catalog of orthologous protein-coding genes across 64 vertebrates, 57 arthropods, 175 fungi, 14 basal metazoans, and 1115 bacteria. Orthology refers to the last common ancestor of the species under consideration, and thus OrthoDB explicitly delineates orthologs at each radiation along the species phylogeny. The database of orthologs presents available protein descriptors, together with Gene Ontology and InterPro attributes, which serve to provide general descriptive annotations of the orthologous groups, and facilitate comprehensive orthology database querying.

## Notes from Users
This website gives a lot of informations of proteines families. The distribution of the family in the tree of life is very cool.
> This database has been done base on several methods of clustering/annotation, these make the families of orthologs robusts and trustworthies.

## Ease of use
Enter your gene/proteine name or id and get a result. The help section is very detailed.
> There are sometimes bugs to get the sequences of a family of orthologs, if it is the case actualise the page or close and reopen.
