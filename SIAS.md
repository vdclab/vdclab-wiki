# Sequence Identity And Similarity (SIAS) 

> SIAS calculates pairwise sequence identity and similarity from multiple sequence alignments while also giving the user control of how amino acid identity scoring and similarity scoring matrixes.

## Website 

- [SIAS *Main Page*](http://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/sias.html)

## Notes from the user
- The user needs to provide a sequence alignment for the proteins they wish to analyze
- Results can be tuned with the interactive scoring values


## Ease of use
> The user interface is a simple series of check boxes and the results are laid out in tables, one for sequence identity and another for amino acid identity.
