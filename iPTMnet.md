## Notes from the user

- iPTMnet currently covers eight major PTM types of PTMs: phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, glycosylation, S-nitrosylation, sumoylation and myristoylation.
- The website contains information on Eukaryotic proteins only. 
- The website provides an interactive Cytoscape view for proteins and their modifications. 
- Users can find information about disease and/or phenotypic evidence linked to mutations in post-translationally modified protein residues.

## Ease of use

- The website is easy to use and the help guide is well-written and helpful.
