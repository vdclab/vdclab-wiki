# Structural Classification of Proteins — extended (SCOPe)

> SCOPe (Structural Classification of Proteins — extended) is a database developed at the Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley to extend the development and maintenance of SCOP. SCOP was conceived at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, and developed in collaboration with researchers in Berkeley. Work on SCOP (version 1) concluded in June 2009 with the release of SCOP 1.75. 
&NewLine;
SCOPe classifies many newer structures through a combination of automation and manual curation, and corrects some errors in SCOP, aiming to have the same accuracy as the hand-curated SCOP releases. SCOPe also incorporates and updates the Astral database.

## Notes from User 
- Not as easy to use as SCOP2 (both based on SCOP classification of proteins)
- Major difference from SCOP2 is integration of [Astral database](http://astral.berkeley.edu) 
- Keeps good track of where annotations came from
