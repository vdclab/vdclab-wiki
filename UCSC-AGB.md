# UCSC Archaeal Genome Browser

> The UCSC Archaeal Genome Browser is a window on the biology of more than 100 microbial species from the domain Archaea. Basic gene annotation is derived from NCBI Genbank/RefSeq entries, with overlays of sequence conservation across multiple species, nucleotide and protein motifs, non-coding RNA predictions, operon predictions, and other types of bioinformatic analyses. In addition, we display available gene expression data (microarray or high-throughput RNA sequencing). Direct contributions or notices of publication of functional genomic data or bioinformatic analyses from archaeal research labs are very welcome.

## Notes from User
- Can create account and save sessions on database
- Focus is genome browser, but contains easy to use tools for archaea
- Can browse for NCBI-coding genes, tRNA-scan, and annotated RNA genes
- No many archaea, but worth checking for those that are present
