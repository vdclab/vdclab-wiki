# Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial Genomes Phylogeny 

> Assess  phylogenetic  composition  of  a  metagenome  sample  based  on  the  distribution of the best BLAST hits of the protein-coding genes found in the dataset.

## Notes from User
- A good tool for comparing genomes between organisms. 
- Locus tags for genes are not standard.
- A go-to profiler because so many genomes are in the database.


## Ease of use
- The tool is simple to use and gives a quick idea of shared genes. Some work is required from the user to translate the non-standard locus tag to distinguish the identified shared genes.
