# Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial Genomes Phylogeny 

> Assess  phylogenetic  composition  of  a  metagenome  sample  based  on  the  distribution of the best BLAST hits of the protein-coding genes found in the dataset. 
{.is-info}

## Notes from User
- A good tool for comparing genomes between organisms 
- Locus tags for genes are not standard


## Ease of use
> The tool is simple to use and gives a quick idea of shared genes. Some work is required from the user to translate the non-standard locus tag to distinguish the identified shared genes.
