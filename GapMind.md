# GapMind

> GapMind is a Web-based tool for annotating amino acid biosynthesis in bacteria and archaea. GapMind incorporates many variant pathways and 130 different reactions, and it analyzes a genome in just 15â€‰s. To avoid error-prone transitive annotations, GapMind relies primarily on a database of experimentally characterized proteins. GapMind correctly handles fusion proteins and split proteins, which often cause errors for best-hit approaches
