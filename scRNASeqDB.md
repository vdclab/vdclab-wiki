# Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) Database

> Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) is fast becoming one powerful tool for high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of cell states and dynamics. With the increasing number of scRNASeq data sets, there is need to provide a web resource which curates public single-cell gene expressing profiles for the wider research community. 
>
> Here, a freely accessible online resource which incorporates 36 human single cell transcriptome data sets (174 cell groups and 8910 single cells) analyzed by scRNA-seq is provided.

## User Notes

- The top 100 positive and negative correlated genes for gene search/experimental results can be downloaded for use in enrichment analysis. (Although direct links to DAVID enrichment do not appear to be functional.
- Each dataset has a well written description of the overall experimental design and summary, as well as links to the dataset and pubmed publication.

## Ease of Use
