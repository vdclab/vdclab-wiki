# The Bahler Lab

> The Bähler laboratory studies cellular quiescence, ageing and long non-coding RNA function using fission yeast and Turquoise Killifish as model systems. We apply diverse genetic, cellular, and systems-level approaches to analyse the regulation and evolution of genomes, complex ageing-associated processes, and relationships between genotype, phenotype and environment.
