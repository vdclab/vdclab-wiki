# Serial Pattern of Expression Levels Locator (SPELL) - S. cerevisiae

> SPELL (Serial Pattern of Expression Levels Locator) is a query-driven search engine for large gene expression microarray compendia. Given a small set of query genes, SPELL identifies which datasets are most informative for these genes, then within those datasets additional genes are identified with expression profiles most similar to the query set. This instance of SPELL currently contains 752 datasets representing 15475 total arrays from 576 published studies.
