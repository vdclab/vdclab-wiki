# The ABCD (AntiBodies Chemically Defined) Database

> The ABCD database provides a comprehensive list of sequenced antibodies with their known targets. Each antibody is assigned a unique ID number that can be used in academic publications to increase reproducibility of experiments.
>
> There are increasing concerns about reproducibility of experimental biomedical research, partially attributed to the lack of reliable and standardized biological reagents. Despite being the most widely used class of protein-binding reagents, antibodies are often poorly characterized and ill-defined, and thus contribute largely to the lack of reliability and reproducibility of biomedical research. The ABCD database promotes the use of standardized and well-characterized antibodies in biomedical results. It reduces the need to use poorly-defined antibodies produced in immunized animals.
