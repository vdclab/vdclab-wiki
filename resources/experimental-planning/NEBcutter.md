# NEBcutter V3.0

> This tool will take a DNA sequence and find the large, non-overlapping open reading frames using the E.coli genetic code and the sites for all Type II and commercially available Type III restriction enzymes that cut the sequence just once. By default, only enzymes available from NEB are used, but other sets may be chosen.The maximum size of the input file is 1 MByte, and the maximum sequence length is 300 KBases.

## Notes from User 
- Easy to use
- Can find restriction sites for available NEB enzymes or all commercial enzymes
- Simple and can see cuts and gel from chosen enzymes
- Focused on bacteria, but can change to query genetic code based upon other organisms under more options on main page
