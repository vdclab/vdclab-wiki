# UF Galaxy

> Galaxy has arisen as the most popular framework for providing biological researchers access to the tools they need for the analysis of their data. It helps researchers survive and thrive in the face of ever growing computational and data management demands of contemporary biology. It also provides the convenience of a robust system of user account handling, data sharing, and security. Since most biological research projects now happen in a distributed collaborative environment, Galaxy's work history sharing and analytical pipeline building, as well as publishing and sharing the results in a convenient and secure manner, address the most important issues and allow UF researchers to be highly competitive. Other benefits of the UF instance of Galaxy are access to the high-speed campus Research Network, use of large HPC cluster resources for running jobs, transparent user account access and convenient data upload, as well as full system and user support by the RC staff.

## Notes from User

- Site functioned better on Google Chrome, difficulty loading on Safari 
- Uses UFRC account 
- Can use tools available on there currently or have new tools input by UF computing center
- worth checking as many file manupulation and reformating tools can make your life esaier in addition to more advance pipelines
