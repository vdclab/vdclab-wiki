## Notes from users 

Although this tool improves the acquisition of data overall, and through overcoming barriers caused by linguistic differences in publishing, synonyms can still be lost to translations. Moreover, select sources appear to demonstrate structural or informational representation issues causing incorrect hits to be returned, even with high-specificity of search terms. 

## Ease of use 

No specific help, but very easy to use and self-explanatory
