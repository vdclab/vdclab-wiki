# European Molecular Biology Laboratory - European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)

> At EMBL-EBI, we make the world’s public biological data freely available to the scientific community via a range of services and tools, perform basic research and provide professional training in bioinformatics. 
>
> We are part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), an international, innovative and interdisciplinary research organisation funded by 26 member states and two associate member states.

## User Notes

- EMBL was established in the Europe in 1974 as an intergovernmental organization funded by public research money from the organization's member states, of which there are currently ~27 (not including associate or prospective members)
- As an organization, sets many standards of biological data usage, formatting, reference and publishing
- Provides a variety of bioinformatic, research/analytic, networking/career services within a large network of service providers, analytical groups/platforms and other organizations, all dedicated to the submission, analysis, formatting, organization, visualization and interpretation of biological data

Other name for this section could be used. Maybe `tools of the website` or `interesting features` or `Other NCBI wiki pages` or `Selected EMBL wiki pages` or `Useful EMBL sub pages`. Need some reflexion about it
