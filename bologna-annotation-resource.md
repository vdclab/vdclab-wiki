# BAR 3.0 Bologna Annotation Resource

> BAR 3.0 is a server for the annotation of protein sequences relying on a comparative large-scale analysis on the entire UniProt. With BAR 3.0 and a sequence you can annotate when possible: function (Gene Ontology), structure (Protein Data Bank), protein domains (Pfam). Also if your sequence falls into a cluster with a structural/some structural template/s we provide an alignment towards the template/templates based on the Cluster-HMM (HMM profile) that allows you to directly compute your 3D model. Cluster HMMs are available for downloading.

## Notes from users 

Categories of search terms are used to yield clusters matching those classifying terms, accessions or IDs. Sequences (FASTA format) can also be used to initiate a search. Caution is advised, as the accuracy of this tool's results is highly-dependent upon the accuracy of annotation in UniProt, from which it pulls and pools information. Creators of site also provide several other bioinformatic services, tools: [Bologna Biocomputing Group](http://www.biocomp.unibo.it/predictors.html)

## Ease of use 

Very easy to use and self-explanatory
