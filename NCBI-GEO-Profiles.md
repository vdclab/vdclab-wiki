# NCBI GEO Profiles

> The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is a public repository that archives and freely distributes comprehensive sets of microarray, next-generation sequencing, and other forms of high-throughput functional genomic data submitted by the scientific community. In addition to data storage, a collection of web-based interfaces and applications are available to help users query and download the studies and gene expression patterns stored in GEO.

- Citing your GEO submission:
-"The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSExxx (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSExxx)."
-	Citing data you find in GEO:
-In addition to citing one of the GEO database papers listed above for general use of GEO, if applicable, you should cite the original paper and the accession number used to identify the experiment(s) in GEO. That way the original generators of the data sets will get credit and allow readers to locate the source. The original paper (if available) is listed under the 'Citation' section of the Series and DataSet records.
