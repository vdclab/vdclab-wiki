# The Complex Portal

> The Complex Portal is a manually curated, encyclopaedic resource of macromolecular complexes from a number of key model organisms, entered into the IntAct molecular interaction database . 
>
> Data includes protein-only complexes as well as protein-small molecule and protein-nucleic acid complexes. All complexes are derived from physical molecular interaction evidences extracted from the literature and cross-referenced in the entry, or by curator inference from information on homologs in closely related species or by inference from scientific background. All complexes are tagged with Evidence and Conclusion Ontology codes  to indicate the type of evidence available for each entry.

## Website 

- [The Complex Portal *Main Page*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/home)
 {.links-list}


## Notes from the user
 - Unique protein interaction viewer that visualizes which portion of protein sequences interact with other proteins
 - Uses several other databases to link pertinent data together in one place

## Ease of use
> A very serviceable database for gene annotation with a unique interaction viewer for protein complexes. Users may have trouble finding their protein, the database is limited to model organisms.

## Help
> There is no specific help section but there are example queries to help familiarize users with the database.
