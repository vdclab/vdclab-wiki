# WebNetCoffee

> WebNetCoffee is a web server based on the algorithm of NetCoffee for aligning multiple PPI networks in order to identify functional ortholog groups. It provides a versatile, interactive and user-friendly interface for easily preparing test datasets, managing submitted jobs and visualizing the alignment results. Users can perform the algorithm on both the online datasets and their own datasets uploaded to the server. To build the online datasets, we manually collected 215,002 proteins and 4,005,485 interactions of 15 species from six openly accessible databases IntAct, STRING, DIP, BioGRID, UniprotKB and Ensembl.

## Notes from the user
- This service takes a while to complete, make sure to save the jobid
- Limited to the organisms list on the website

## Ease of use
> Using the tool is not too difficult, you select organisms and which database to use and you initiate the service. The data upload is a little more complicated which require a PPI network file or a sequence similarity file.
