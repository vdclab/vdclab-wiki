# The Bio-Analytic Resource for Plant Biology

> Welcome to the Bio-Analytic Resource at the University of Toronto. The BAR is maintained by Dr. Nicholas Provart and his lab. The BAR is funded in part by Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution and Function, grants from the Canada Foundation for Innovation to Dr. Provart, and from Genome Canada to the Arabidopsis Research Group at the Department of Cell and Systems Biology, University of Toronto. The BAR may be used to explore large-scale data sets from Arabidopsis and other species, and for hypothesis generation. Questions that can be answered are, for example, are there any genes that are co-expressed with my gene of interest? Are there any predicted interactors with my favourite protein? Where is my gene expressed? Use Expression Angler, the Arabidopsis Interactions Viewer, and the eFP Browser, respectively, to answer such questions!

## Notes from user
- Great visualization tools for expression and localization data
- Some of the tools are out of date and need updating (like the BLASTDigester)
- The focus of the website is plants but there are some human expression tools mixed in
- Lots of different plant species specific tools

## Ease of use
> The website is a modern design with the tools (some are plant species specific) being organized into 3 catagories. The interface for the expression tools are complex and the results are incredibly detailed. The expression data shows physiological localization on cartoon images of plants. I couldn't get some of the molecular marker tools to work (they require an up to date java).
