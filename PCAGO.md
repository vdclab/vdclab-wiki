# PCAGO

> PCAGO is a tool to analyze RNA-Seq results with principal component analysis. You can use it to:
-Check if samples with the same treatment/condition cluster together.
-Find out how including less and less variant genes affect this clustering.
-Find sets of genes that explain most of the data.
&NewLine;
PCAGO provides additional features that lets you do your tasks easier, like …
-Filtering genes by biotype, GO terms and scaffold.
-Animating the clustering live when less and less variant genes are included.
-Importing annotations directly from online databases like Ensembl BioMart.
