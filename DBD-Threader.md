# DBD-Threader

> DBD-Threader is a program for predicting the DNA-binding function of a protein. The program is a threading-based approach that requires only sequence as input. If the protein is predicted as DNA-binding, the program will report its DNA-binding domain(s) detected and DNA-binding protein residues. Details of the method is described in the reference below.
