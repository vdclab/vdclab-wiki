# SWISS-MODEL

> SWISS-MODEL is a web-based integrated service dedicated to protein structure homology modelling. It guides the user in building protein homology models at different levels of complexity.
&NewLine;
Building a homology model comprises four main steps: (i) identification of structural template(s), (ii) alignment of target sequence and template structure(s), (iii) model-building, and (iv) model quality evaluation. These steps require specialised software and integrate up-to-date protein sequence and structure databases. Each of the above steps can be repeated interactively until a satisfying modelling result is achieved.
