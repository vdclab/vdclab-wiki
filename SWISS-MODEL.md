# SWISS-MODEL

> SWISS-MODEL is a web-based integrated service dedicated to protein structure homology modelling. It guides the user in building protein homology models at different levels of complexity.
&NewLine;
Building a homology model comprises four main steps: (i) identification of structural template(s), (ii) alignment of target sequence and template structure(s), (iii) model-building, and (iv) model quality evaluation. These steps require specialised software and integrate up-to-date protein sequence and structure databases. Each of the above steps can be repeated interactively until a satisfying modelling result is achieved.

## Notes from user
-  A structure modeling service that has the additional feature of modeling multiple aligned sequences
- User will need to submit their request and leave an email to recieve results later
- Good source for identifying protein domains and ligand interactions



## Ease of use
> This service offers high quality results from a simple interface. There are some example exercises for the user to read through to familiarize themselves with the detailed results and what they mean. The user might need to play with the sequence submission field to get the tool to work correctly.
