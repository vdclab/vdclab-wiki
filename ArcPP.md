# The Archaeal Proteome Project (ArcPP)

>  ArcPP collects a diverse set MS data sets, uses state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools for their comprehensive analysis and expert knowledge from a broad range of fields for the interpretation of results. Starting with the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii, we have:
>  - Reanalyzed more than 23 Mio. spectra
>  - Optimized the analysis using parameter sweeps, multiple search engines implemented in Ursgal, and the combination of results through the combined PEP approach
>  - Thoroughly controlled false discovery rates for high confidence protein identifications using the picked protein FDR approach and limiting FDR to 0.5%
>  - Identified more than 40k peptides, corresponding to 2,930 proteins (>72% of the proteome) with a median sequence coverage of 51%.
