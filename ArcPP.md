# The Archaeal Proteome Project (ArcPP)

>  ArcPP collects a diverse set MS data sets, uses state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools for their comprehensive analysis and expert knowledge from a broad range of fields for the interpretation of results. Starting with the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii, we have:
> 
> • Reanalyzed more than 23 Mio. spectra
> • Optimized the analysis using parameter sweeps, multiple search engines implemented in Ursgal, and the combination of results through the combined PEP approach
> • Thoroughly controlled false discovery rates for high confidence protein identifications using the picked protein FDR approach and limiting FDR to 0.5%
> • Identified more than 40k peptides, corresponding to 2,930 proteins (>72% of the proteome) with a median sequence coverage of 51%.

## Website 

- [ArcPP *Main Page*](https://archaealproteomeproject.org/)
 {.links-list}


## Ease of Use

- The website allows users to browse data. It is well designed and easy to use.

## User Notes

- Currently the website only has the completed proteome and data for *Haloferax volcanii*, but the goal of the developers is to expand the database with additional Archaeal proteomes.
- Data files can be downloaded for further processing.
- All scripts used in proteome analysis can be found on the GitHub page.
- "Please contact us with any questions, contributions or issues. Feel free to open issues and pull request on our GitHub page or contact us at archaealproteomeproject@gmail.com"
