## Notes from User
- Can map transcriptomic and proteomic data directly onto pathways 
- App for phone: can browse genes (BLAST, phenotypes, etc.), regulons and metabolism. Easy to use and can contact community directly there 
- Has list of labs working on B. subtilis, as well, on gene pages lists labs working on that gene/protein
