# FuzDB

> FuzDB compiles experimentally observed fuzzy protein complexes, where intrinsic disorder (ID) is maintained upon interacting with a partner (protein, nucleic acid or small molecule) and directly impacts biological function.
>
> FuzDB also provides interpretation of experimental results to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which fuzzy regions—classified on the basis of topology and mechanism—interfere with the structural ensembles and activity of protein assemblies. Regulatory sites generated by alternative splicing (AS) or post-translational modifications (PTMs) are also collected.
