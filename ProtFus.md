# ProtFus

> ProtFus is a resource that has information about fusion proteins and their interactions, based on a text mining approach. "Tagging" is a process of registering the mention of given entities in a particular document. With increase in size of scientific literature, efficient methods of text mining will greatly help for extracting and interpreting useful information present in free texts, thus assist in real time queries.

## User Notes
- This resource illustrates efforts initiated to help improve data capture from the literature; this one, in particular, leverages text-mining methods and is largely motivated by drug target discovery in the treatment of cancer
- most helpful for human-centered research
 
## Ease of Use
A basic understanding of text-mining principles is helpful for use of their services and exportable datasets. The general format is relatively simple, but this and similar tools are seldom appropriate for novice users. The help page is recommended for those unfamiliar with the website or text-mining methods.
