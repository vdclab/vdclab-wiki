# ProtFus

> ProtFus is a resource that has information about fusion proteins and their interactions, based on a text mining approach. "Tagging" is a process of registering the mention of given entities in a particular document. With increase in size of scientific literature, efficient methods of text mining will greatly help for extracting and interpreting useful information present in free texts, thus assist in real time queries.
