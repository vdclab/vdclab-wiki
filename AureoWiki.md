# AureoWiki

> The wiki-type database AureoWiki was established to make the wealth of information on S. aureus available to both CRC-TRR34 members and external users. AureoWiki centers on the genes and proteins of three widely used S. aureus model strains (COL, N315 and NCTC 8325), compiling information related to a given gene/gene product on a single page. 
>
> Orthologous genes of the three strains are presented side by side: they are linked by so called unified "Pangenome" IDs and gene symbols. Importantly, users can add and update information. Hence, the collective knowledge of the S. aureus researchers will be combined providing the community with comprehensive, up-to-date information.
