# AureoWiki

> The wiki-type database AureoWiki was established to make the wealth of information on S. aureus available to both CRC-TRR34 members and external users. AureoWiki centers on the genes and proteins of three widely used S. aureus model strains (COL, N315 and NCTC 8325), compiling information related to a given gene/gene product on a single page. 
>
> Orthologous genes of the three strains are presented side by side: they are linked by so called unified "Pangenome" IDs and gene symbols. Importantly, users can add and update information. Hence, the collective knowledge of the S. aureus researchers will be combined providing the community with comprehensive, up-to-date information.

## Website 

- [AureoWiki *Main Page*](https://aureowiki.med.uni-greifswald.de/Main_Page)
 {.links-list}

## Notes from the user
- This database uses locus tags from specific strains of *Staphylococcus aureus*
- Lots of annotations and links available for well characterized proteins

## Ease of use
> The database is as easy to use as any annotation database, but the trick is to know which locus tags to use. The database is limited to these strains: COL, N315, NCTC8325, Newman and USA300_FPR3757.
