## Notes from the user
- Part of the Sequence Manipulation Suite
- Converts DNA sequences into a reverse complement, complement, or reverse sequence. 

## Ease of use

This tool is very easy to use but surprisingly helpful. Input your sequence as either fasta format or just a string of nucleotides and then select which option you want your sequence transformed into.
