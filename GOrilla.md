## User Notes
- Limited to eukaryotic model organisms, but user-friendly/easy-to-use/straight-forward
- Example is a little less-than-ideal for naive/less-experienced users
- Resulting visualizations are more heuristic than they are empirically-driving or foundational to any further measured analysis;
- Data input appears somewhat free-form or vulnerable to information interpretation-/mapping-driven errors/misrepresentations in subsequent enrichment or tool output
- Data/results/rendering export could be improved; last updates were posted in March 2013
