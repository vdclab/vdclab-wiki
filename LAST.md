# LAST Web Service (Dotplots)

> LAST can:
> • Handle big sequence data.
> • Indicate the reliability of each aligned column.
> • Use sequence quality data properly.
> • Compare DNA to proteins, with frameshifts.
> • Compare PSSMs to sequences.
> • Calculate the likelihood of chance similarities between random sequences.
> • Do split and spliced alignment.
> • Train alignment parameters for unusual kinds of sequence (e.g. nanopore).

## Notes from Users
- Alignment customisable. 
- DNA or protein sequences.
- The colouring is a little bit unfortunate to read the alignment.

## Ease of use
- Enter 2 sets of sequences to align.
- Get a graphic reprenstation of the alignments and the alignments.
