# LAST Web Service

> LAST can:
> - Handle big sequence data.
> - Indicate the reliability of each aligned column.
> - Use sequence quality data properly.
> - Compare DNA to proteins, with frameshifts.
> - Compare PSSMs to sequences.
> - Calculate the likelihood of chance similarities between random sequences.
> - Do split and spliced alignment.
> - Train alignment parameters for unusual kinds of sequence (e.g. nanopore).
