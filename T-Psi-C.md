# T-Psi-C Database

> T-psi-C database is an up-to-date collection of tRNA sequences that contains data obtained from high-throughput tRNA sequencing, e.g. all isoacceptors and isodecoders for human HEK293 cells. This database also contains 3D tRNA structures obtained from Protein Data Bank and generated using homology modeling.
>
> The T-psi-C database can be continuously updated by any member of the scientific community, and contains its own application programming interface (API), which allows users to retrieve or upload data in JSON format. Altogether, T-psi-C is user-friendly, easy to develop and an up-to-date source of knowledge about tRNAs.
