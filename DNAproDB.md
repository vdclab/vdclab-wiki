# DNAproDB

> DNAproDB is a database, structure processing pipeline and web-based visualization tool which makes structural analysis of DNA-protein complexes easy. This database contains structural and biochemical features extracted from 4623 structures of DNA-protein complexes contained in the Protein Data Bank. This data can be used to analyze individual structures or to generate large datasets by constructing queries on a set of features. Additionally, you can upload your own structure and use the same processing and visualization tools for unpublished data.

## Notes from the user
 
 - Must have a structure with DNA in it already.
 - Good visualization of the positioning of the amino acids but not visualization of direct base-amino acid interaction.

 
## Ease of use

- Hard to search for interactions.
- Quick search bar was not functionning.
