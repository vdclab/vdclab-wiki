# DNAproDB

> DNAproDB is a database, structure processing pipeline and web-based visualization tool which makes structural analysis of DNA-protein complexes easy. This database contains structural and biochemical features extracted from 4623 structures of DNA-protein complexes contained in the Protein Data Bank. This data can be used to analyze individual structures or to generate large datasets by constructing queries on a set of features. Additionally, you can upload your own structure and use the same processing and visualization tools for unpublished data.
