# ETE Toolkit

> The Python Environment for tree expoloration is a python framework available for the user to download and use for the analysis and visualization of trees. Additionally, there are instructions for phylogenetic tools within the the environment available for the user to further analyze their trees.

## Notes from the user
- Will require knowledge of python and how to instal the environment
- A programmable tree with complete control over how the tree is visualized
- The "Tree Viewer" tool allows the user to view a tree next to a sequence alignment

## Ease of use
> The python environment is a harder tool to use than other online options but offers more control of the tree and what information is displayed.
