# TopSearch

> TopSearch is a new powerful gateway to protein structures and their structural relationships. Given a query structure the search engine instantly returns a list of known protein structures sorted by structural similarity. 
>
> TopSearch operates on three structural levels: chains, biological assemblies/quaternary structures (yes, including ribosomes!), and asymmetric units. All at the same speed! In working with structures, numbers are not enough - with TopSearch you see what you get. Immediately!
