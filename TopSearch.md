# TopSearch

> TopSearch is a new powerful gateway to protein structures and their structural relationships. Given a query structure the search engine instantly returns a list of known protein structures sorted by structural similarity. 
>
> TopSearch operates on three structural levels: chains, biological assemblies/quaternary structures (yes, including ribosomes), and asymmetric units. All at the same speed! In working with structures, numbers are not enough - with TopSearch you see what you get.

## Website 

- [TopSearch *Main Page*](https://topsearch.services.came.sbg.ac.at/)
 {.links-list}

## User Notes
- If page does not load properly, you may have to simply reload the page and re-enter your query, or try using a different browser
- Great for quick visualization and comparison of protein crystal structures available in PDB (Protein Data Bank) (TopSearch -> select structures to show; TopMatch -> select structures to compare/align/superimpose)
 
## Ease of Use
The help page (below) is highly recommended for those new to the tool, as it provides a step-by-step guide on how to use its basic features; difficult to use for some browsers due to production limitations on part of the creative team.
