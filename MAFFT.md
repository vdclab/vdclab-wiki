# MAFFT 

> MAFFT has several different options for computing large MSAs consisting of thousands of sequences. Our service also has some additional functions (interactive sequence selection and phylogenetic inference) for preprocessing and postprocessing MSA. Moreover, these processes can be circularly performed as necessary.
