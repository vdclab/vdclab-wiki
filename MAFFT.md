# MAFFT 

> MAFFT has several different options for computing large MSAs consisting of thousands of sequences. Our service also has some additional functions (interactive sequence selection and phylogenetic inference) for preprocessing and postprocessing MSA. Moreover, these processes can be circularly performed as necessary.

## Notes from User
- Easy to use
- If you paste the protein or DNA sequence, make sure it fits within the box (when copied from some sources, it pasted it as a single line and the tool does not recognize the sequence as this)
- Good advanced settings for controlling parameters used to calculate, but good default settings for quick use
