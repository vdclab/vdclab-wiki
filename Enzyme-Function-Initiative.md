# Enzyme Function Initiative 

> This website contains a collection of webtools for creating and interacting with sequence similarity networks (SSNs) and genome neighborhood networks (GNNs). These tools originated in the Enzyme Function Initiative, a NIH-funded research project to develop a sequence / structure-based strategy for facilitating discovery of in vitro enzymatic and in vivo metabolic / physiological functions of unknown enzymes discovered in genome projects.
