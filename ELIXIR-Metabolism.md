# ELIXIR Microbial Metabolism Resource

> The microbial world provides an abundant source of biological catalysts for chemicals of medical and economic interest such as pharmaceuticals and biofuels. However, a sustainable resource for systems biology, that integrates experimental and predicted data on microbial metabolism, is still lacking. This Implementation Study defines the requirements for a European Bioinformatics resource for microbial metabolism as well as providing a practical demonstration of how existing funded resources from ELIXIR partners could be integrated to meet those needs.
