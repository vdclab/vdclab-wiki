# PathoPhenoDB

> PathoPhenoDB aims to support diagnosis of infectious diseases caused by known pathogens. The database relies on the pathogen-to-phenotype associations. Pathogen-disease relations are linked to disease-phenotypes by using text mining methods.

## Website 

- [PathoPhenoDB *Main Page*](http://patho.phenomebrowser.net/#/)

## User Notes
 - (8/21/2020; CJR) Emailed reference publication contact regarding improvements to the website (re. user-friendliness, not in response to technical issues; e.g., adding an interactive search sidebar to the data visualization on the *Explore* page)
 - Simple tool for microbial pathogen phenotypes; more helpful for work focused on microbes associated with human pathogenesis/disease
 
## Ease of Use
Quick loading; intuitive search auto-complete drop-down, but best use results from slow* input of search term(s), as results are specific and limited to their curated database.
