title: The VarSite Database
description: VarSite aims to annotate known disease-associated variants in human genes with structural information from the 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The annotations are visualized using simple graphic depictions and various 3D molecular viewers.

# The VarSite Database

> VarSite is a web server mapping known disease‐associated variants from UniProt and ClinVar, together with natural variants from gnomAD, onto protein 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank. The analyses are primarily image‐based and provide both an overview for each human protein, as well as a report for any specific variant of interest. The information can be useful in assessing whether a given variant might be pathogenic or benign.
>
> The structural annotations for each position in the protein include protein secondary structure, interactions with ligand, metal, DNA/RNA, or other protein, and various measures of a given variant's possible impact on the protein's function. The 3D locations of the disease‐associated variants can be viewed interactively via the 3dmol.js JavaScript viewer, as well as in RasMol and PyMOL. Users can search for specific variants, or sets of variants, by providing the DNA coordinates of the base change(s) of interest.

## Notes from the user
- A part of the EMBL-EBI suite of tools
- Users can look for diseases associated with a protein of interest or search for proteins with a disease of interest

## Ease of use

This database is easy to browse with two main ways to search for proteins. It is easy to find proteins from the graphical layout of human diseases on the body.
