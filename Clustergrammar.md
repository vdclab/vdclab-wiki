# Clustergrammar

> Clustergrammer is a web-based tool for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional data as interactive and shareable hierarchically clustered heatmaps. Clustergrammer enables intuitive exploration of high-dimensional data and has several optional biology-specific features.

## Notes from user
- This tool is a great option for making interactive and high detail heatmaps.
- In order to get the data to appear as a blue to white to red gradient, data values must range from  negative values to 0 to positive values respectively.
- Meta data can be added to each item in each row or column in the heatmap data.
- The web-tool can be downloaded and run offline for power users
- Clustergrammer also makes similarity matrixes for the rows and the columns automatically
- Heatmaps come with their own permenant links that users can quickly share with others

## Ease of use
> Clustergrammer makes good looking and easy to use heatmaps that can quickly be shared with others. The webtool offers a fair level of customization and is easy to upload data too. Some care needs to be taken with the way the data is formated, examine the provided example data closely and mimic the format for best results.
