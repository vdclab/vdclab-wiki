# MultAlin Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)

>  Multalin creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive pairwise alignments.
&NewLine;
This web-based automatic alignment system allows users to easily set parameters for preferred symbol comparison tabels (ex. Blosum62), gap penalties and gap penalties at extremities and is useful for producing multiple sequence alignments to provide a starting point for a more human analysis.
