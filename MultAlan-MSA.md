# MultAlin Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)

>  This software will allow you to align simultaneously several biological sequences.
&NewLine;
What is a Multiple sequence alignment? It is the arrangement of several protein or nucleic acid sequences with postulated gaps so that similar residues are juxtaposed. A positive score is attached to identities, conservative or non-conservative substitutions (the score amplitude measuring the similarity) and a penalty to gaps; an ideal program would maximise the total score, taking account of all possible alignments and allowing for any length gap at any position.
&NewLine;
Unfortunately the computing requirements, both of time and memory, grow as the nth power, where n is the sequence number, so this ideal alignment can be found only for two sequences or three short sequences. In the general case, to be practicable programs must restrict the conditions of the optimisation. Nevertheless it is undeniably useful to have an automatic system available for multiple sequence alignment to provide a starting point for a more human analysis.
&NewLine;
Multalin creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive pairwise alignments.
