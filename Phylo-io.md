# Phylo.io

> Phylo.io is a state of the art tool for visualising and comparing phylogenetic trees on the web. It can be used to view a single tree, or compare the internal structure of two differently inferred trees for the same group of taxons. Phylo.io includes a number of useful features to make the viewing and comparing of even very large trees extremely easy.
