## User Notes
- Bioinformatics Club site (outside of the text itself and its companion website) makes available the most comprehensive, up-to-date resources for bioinformatic topics as they were approached by the authors within the companion text (<i>Practical Computing for Biologists</i>, 2018)

> Last blog post was in early 2015; much of the Bioinformatics Club site information and its relevance may be limited to that most recent year of update.
