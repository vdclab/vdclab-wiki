# GiantVirus

> Welcome to the Giant Virus site, home of mimivirus and other large DNA viruses. This site will try to offer the latest news and authoritative analyses on Mimivirus genome and proteome data, as well as comparative analyses with other known and future large DNA viruses. Links are also provided to resources and new data relevant to the rapidly expanding field of large DNA viruses. 
&NewLine;
Our objective is to help creating a sense of community among researchers working on large viruses, promoting collaborations beyond established phylogenetic clades, to generate new ideas for research, and ultimately understand the biological/evolutionary significance of very large viruses (oddities w/o fundamental meaning, living fossils from an extinct domain/kingdom, missing links between prokarya and eukarya,..., etc).

 ## Notes from the user
 - This database is geared for information about large DNA viruses genomes, specifically Mimivirus
 
 
 ## Ease of use
> The website has a collection of databases/tools that specialize in Mimiviruse analysis. Some of the databses/tools are simply a collection of previously analyzed data which the user can browse, and others allow the user to interact with the tool like the BLAST tool.
