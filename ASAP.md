# ASAP

> ASAP (a systematic annotation package for community analysis of genomes) is a relational database and web interface developed to store, update and distribute genome sequence data and gene expression data collected by or in collaboration with researchers at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.
>
> ASAP was designed to facilitate ongoing community annotation of genomes and to grow with genome projects as they move from the preliminary data stage through post-sequencing functional analysis. The ASAP database includes multiple genome sequences at various stages of analysis, and gene expression data from preliminary experiments. Use of some of this preliminary data is conditional, and it is the users responsibility to read the data release policy and to verify that any use of specific data obtained through ASAP is consistent with this policy. Any questions regarding this policy or restrictions for specific data should be referred to ASAPdbAdmin@ahabs.wisc.edu.

## Notes from User 
- Takes some time to navigate through site and tools 
- For subset of bacteria
- Experimental work only with a few of the organisms which have genomes on site
