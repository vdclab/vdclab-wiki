# plprot

> plprot - a plastid protein database-integrates data from large scale proteome analyses of different plastid types.These include etioplasts, chloroplasts, chromoplasts and the undifferentiated proplastid-like organelles of tobacco BY2 cells. This comparison allows establishing a core proteome that is common to all plastid types and provides furthermore information about plastid type-specific functions.
