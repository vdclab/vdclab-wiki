# The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD)

> The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database ("CARD") provides data, models, and algorithms relating to the molecular basis of antimicrobial resistance. The CARD provides curated reference sequences and SNPs organized via the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology ("ARO"). 
>
> These data can be browsed on the website or downloaded in a number of formats. These data are additionally associated with detection models, in the form of curated homology cut-offs and SNP maps, for prediction of resistome from molecular sequences. These models can be downloaded or can be used for analysis of genome sequences using the Resistance Gene Identifier ("RGI"), either online or as a stand-alone tool.
