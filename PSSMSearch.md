# PSSMSearch

> PSSMSearch is a web application to discover novel protein motifs (SLiMs, mORFs, miniMotifs) and PTM sites. PSSMSearch analyses proteomes for regions with significant similarity to a specificity determinant model built from a set of aligned functional peptides.
>
> Query peptides can be provided by the users or retrieved from the ELM database. Multiple scoring methods are available to build a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) describing the specificity determinant model and users can modify the model to add prior knowledge of specificity determinants through an interactive PSSM heatmap.
