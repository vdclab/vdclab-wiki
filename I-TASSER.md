# Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement (I-TASSER)

> I-TASSER (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement) is a hierarchical approach to protein structure and function prediction. It first identifies structural templates from the PDB by multiple threading approach LOMETS, with full-length atomic models constructed by iterative template-based fragment assembly simulations. Function insights of the target are then derived by re-threading the 3D models through protein function database BioLiP. 
&NewLine;
I-TASSER (as 'Zhang-Server') was ranked as the No 1 server for protein structure prediction in recent community-wide CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, CASP10, CASP11, CASP12, and CASP13 experiments. It was also ranked as the best for function prediction in CASP9. The server is in active development with the goal to provide the most accurate protein structure and function predictions using state-of-the-art algorithms.
