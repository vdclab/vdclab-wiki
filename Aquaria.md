# Aquaria

> Aquaria is a web-tool that allows for the visualization of protein structure of various proteins from numerous species.
{.is-info}

## Notes from user
- A simple protein structure visualization tool with a suprising ammount of utility
- Lacking more advanced features such as changing color of residues or highlighting domains of proteins
- Can be used to visualize any protein in the PDB
- Provides annotation for the protein from external databases such as Uniprot
- Can be used for any organism with known protein structures
- the most recent structures are missing

## Ease of use
> Using the web-tool is easy, queries can be as gene names or IDs and the user can specify the organism to further filter results. The controls to explore the protein in 3D are intuitive and can all be operated from a mouse. A great option to quickly visualize a protein but some users might find this tool too basic.
