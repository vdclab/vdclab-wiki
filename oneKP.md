# oneKP

> The 1000 plants (oneKP or 1KP) initiative is an international multi-disciplinary consortium that has generated large-scale gene sequencing data for over 1000 species of plants. 
&NewLine;
Sample selection was based on a series of overlapping sub-projects with scientific objectives that could be addressed by the sequencing of multiple plant species. As more collaborators joined 1KP, however, the objectives evolved and are now exemplified by the diverse collection of papers described by the links on the home page.
