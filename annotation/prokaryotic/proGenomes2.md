# ProGenomes 3

> ProGenomes v3 provides over 900,000 consistently annotated bacterial and archaeal genomes containing 4 billion genes from over 40,000 species. Strict quality controls are employed for the included genomes to enable accurate analyses. The genomes can be interactively explored and downloaded, whereby subsets can be customized e.g. taxonomic clades, representatives of each species or habitat-specific subsets. For each specI species cluster, precomputed pangenomes are available.
