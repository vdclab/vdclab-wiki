# InterPro

> From InterPro's website: "InterPro provides functional analysis of proteins by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites. To classify proteins in this way, InterPro uses predictive models, known as signatures, provided by several different databases (referred to as member databases) that make up the InterPro consortium. We combine protein signatures from these member databases into a single searchable resource, capitalising on their individual strengths to produce a powerful integrated database and diagnostic tool.".

## User Notes
 
 - HMM-based for its own classification system.
  - One of few sequence annotation databases permitting overlaps of HMM signatures or hierarchical links between signatures.
 - While its sequence-based analyses are (as of Dec. 2023) without compare among open-access intergrated annotation databases, the export of annotations (individual or otherwise) tend to be incompatible with typical, tabular mapping procedures (i.e., no tabular exports, or, if available, are usually unmanageable for the browser-mediated execution, especially if the family of export is very large).
