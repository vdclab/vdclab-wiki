# TIGRFams

> From the remaining legacy website: "TIGRFAMs is a resource consisting of curated multiple sequence alignments, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for protein sequence classification, and associated information designed to support automated annotation of (mostly prokaryotic) proteins. Starting with release 10.0, TIGRFAMs models use HMMER3, which provides excellent search speed as well as exquisite search sensitivity. See the "TIGRFAMs Complete Listing" page to review the accession, protein name, model type, and EC number (if assigned) of all models. TIGRFAMs is a member database in InterPro. The HMM libraries and supporting files are available to download and use for free from our FTP site."

> As of September 2014, annotations per the legacy website have not been updated, but system has been integrated into the InterPro Database.
