# Binding-MOAD

> We have created a subset of the Protein Data Bank (PDB), containing every high-quality example of ligand-protein binding. Hence, we call it the Mother of All Databases (MOAD). 
&NewLine;
Binding MOAD's goal is to be the largest collection of well resolved protein crystal structures with clearly identified biologically relevant ligands annotated with experimentally determined binding data extracted from literature.

## User Notes

- Many PDB searches are non-productive, but the reason for their exclusion (ex: does not meet resolution cutoff, no valid ligands, etc) from the database. 
- There is no easy way to browse for data from a specific organism. 
- For help email: BindingMOAD@UMich.edu.

## Ease of Use

- There is no formal help page or tutorial for use, but the site is fairly intuitive.
