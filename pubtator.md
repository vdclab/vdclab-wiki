# PubTator

> PubTator is a Web-based tool for accelerating manual literature curation (e.g. annotating biological entities and their relationships) through the use of advanced text-mining techniques. As an all-in-one system, PubTator provides one-stop service for annotating PubMed citations. We keep in sync with PubMed and update automatic computer annotations every day. See our PubTator presentation here.

## Notes from users 

Helpful for more specialized, text-based searches; efficacy of results will be determined by terms used, as with any search engine. Particulraly good to search for gene ids.

## Ease of use 

No specific help, but very easy to use and self-explanatory
