# EcoCyc

> EcoCyc is a scientific database for the bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. The EcoCyc project performs literature-based curation of its genome, and of transcriptional regulation, transporters, and metabolic pathways. The longterm goal of the project is to describe the complete molecular catalog of the E. coli cell, as well as the functions of each of its molecular parts, to facilitate a system-level understanding of E. coli. 
&NewLine;
The database includes information pages on each E. coli gene product, metabolite, reaction, operon, and metabolic pathway. The database also includes information on E. coli gene essentiality and on nutrient conditions that do or do not support the growth of E. coli. The website and downloadable software contain tools for analysis of high-throughput data sets. 
&NewLine;
In addition, a steady-state metabolic flux model is generated from each new version of EcoCyc and can be executed via the database. The model can predict metabolic flux rates, nutrient uptake rates, and growth rates for different gene knockouts and nutrient conditions. This review outlines the data content of EcoCyc and of the procedures by which this content is generated. EcoCyc provides tools for navigating, visualizing, and analyzing the underlying databases, and for analyzing omics data.

## User Notes

- EcoCyc is a member of the BioCyc database collection and features the same website layout and tools.
- EcoCyc focuses specifically on <i>Escherichia coli</i> str. K-12 MG1655, but data/information relevant to other strains or species can be found, and links will automatically redirect you to BioCyc for viewing. 
- Users can reach the BioCyc Omics Dashboard (for analysis/visualization of omics data) from EcoCyc home page.
