# Integrative Multi-species Prediction (IMP)

> Analyze your experimental results in the functional context of gene-gene networks from multiple organisms. Use IMP to direct additional functional experiments by identifying novel gene participants in a pathway or additional processes that a gene of interest participates in. Functional genomics can complement traditional sequence similarity to improve the transfer of gene annotations between organisms. In particular, functional knowledge transfer (FKT) can improve the accuracy and coverage of gene-function predictions in under-studied processes (i.e. biological processes that are not well studied in a particular organism of interest but might be well characterized in another organism).

## Notes from user
- A good, interactive gene network tool
- Can be used to search for a set of genes or single genes
- Specific for a few model organisms
- Users can save searches and gene networks

## Ease of use
> There are tutorials availabe in either a video format or a guided case study. Results are easy to comprehend and the networks results can be made more or less stringent in real time.
