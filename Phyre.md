# Phyre

> Phyre is a free web-based services for protein structure prediction.
{.is-info}

## Notes from user
- A great service for predicting protein structure from amino acid sequences
- It is prudent to use other prediction software (COACH, SWISS-MODEL, etc...) to verify the results
- Users will need to leave their email address and view the results later when the service finishes

## Ease of use
> This tool is a simple and easy to use service. Simply leave your amino acid sequence and contact information and wait for the structure results. The user can also search for existing sequences for proteins but other websites are better suited for this.
