## Notes from User
- When using analysis, boxes to right give description of tool and allowed gene IDs for selected species as it varies per species 
- Once data is submitted and run (depending on number of genes input) gives two options for types of visualization, very easy 
- Can edit images some, but not full control of image colors, etc.
