# Genoscope Microscope Services

> Access to the MicroScope web site (hosted at Genoscope), which provides an environment for expert annotation and comparative genomics. 
&NewLine;
Technical support is provided by LABGeM for all users. Bioanalysis / Scientific expertise by LABGeM is restricted to « Collaborations » only.

## Notes from users
- Limited set of genomes but I think it is the best integarted platform to annoate a microbial genomes for an "annoation group" 
- Many intergrated tools for comparative genomics such as AntoSmash, Or pathogenicity island finders   and  and also some unique features like minimal and pangenomes sets. 

## Ease of Use
- Things can get complicated as many windows open
- Java issues make it sometimes very fustrating. 
- Making the patwhays tools linked to BioCyc is also tricky as the if you have not looded the genome a few days ahaead they do not work .
- Extensive [Tutorials](https://microscope.readthedocs.io/en/v3.14.0/) available.
