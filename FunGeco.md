**Single genome analysis:** This feature allows the user to input a newly sequenced genome and annotate it using gene context based modules generated using extensive literature mining and manual curation. Users can also carry out comparative analysis (synteny view using parallel coordinates) of the uploaded genome with genomes already sequenced in NCBI using interactive visualizations.
&NewLine;
**16s rRNA microbial abundance data analysis:** This feature requires users to upload two files namely the microbial abundance matrix and a metadata file corresponding to a set of metagenomic samples. The input information is used to calculate the functional abundance profile based on functional pathway constitution. Further, the samples are clustered by Principal Component Analysis using the functional potential and displayed as an interactive plot overlaying the metadata information. Inter sample, taxa and functional relationships can be visualized using an interactive hive plot.
&NewLine;
**Multiple genome analysis:** This feature allows comparison of functional modules in sequenced genomes obtained from NCBI. Users can interactively select upto five genomes which are compared using a synteny based visualization (parallel coordinates) and circular genomic representations. Information about individual modules in all these genomes can also be viewed as tabular outputs.
