# RDP - Seqmatch

> Sequence Match finds the nearest neighbors of your query sequences by picking up those database sequences that have the highest numbers of the shared 7-mers ("word") with the specific query sequence. It is not based on any alignment. There is no bit-saved score or E-value generated but a S_ab score that is the percentage of shared words between sequences compared.

## User Notes

Classifier now provides gene copy number adjustment for 16S gene sequences. The 16S gene copy number data is provided by rrnDB website.

FunGene is a functional gene pipeline and repository.  Genes that have functional roles in antibiotic resistance, for example, can be found/deposited here. 

MlxS Google Sheet helps you analyze/manage your metadata and choose an appropriate marker gene for analysis
