# RDP - Seqmatch

> Sequence Match finds the nearest neighbors of your query sequences by picking up those database sequences that have the highest numbers of the shared 7-mers ("word") with the specific query sequence. It is not based on any alignment. There is no bit-saved score or E-value generated but a S_ab score that is the percentage of shared words between sequences compared.
