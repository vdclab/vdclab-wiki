title: RDP - Ribosomal Database Project
description: RDP provides a suite of analysis tools to the scientific community, including Sequence Match (SeqMatch) which is similar to BLASTn, but chooses nearest neighbors based on 7mer/"word" matches rather than alignment-based methods.

# RDP - Ribosomal Database Project

> RDP provides quality-controlled, aligned and annotated Bacterial and Archaeal 16S rRNA sequences, and Fungal 28S rRNA sequences, and a suite of analysis tools to the scientific community. Analysis tools include: Hierarchy Browser, Classifier, Probe Match, FunGene, MlxS GoogleSheets, Library Compare, Sequence Match, RDPipeline, Aligner, Tree Builder and RDP Open Source.

## User Notes

There are tutorials available for each analysis tool included in the RDP suite. 

Classifier now provides gene copy number adjustment for 16S gene sequences. The 16S gene copy number data is provided by rrnDB website.

FunGene is a functional gene pipeline and repository.  Genes that have functional roles in antibiotic resistance, for example, can be found/deposited here. 

MlxS Google Sheet helps you analyze/manage your metadata and choose an appropriate marker gene for analysis
