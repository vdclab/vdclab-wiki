# CyanoEXpress

> CyanoEXpress is a user-friendly web-server, which enables interactive exploration of curated genome-wide expression data for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. CyanoEXpress is regularly updated with new data retrieved from public repositories: Gene Expression Omnibus, ArrayExpress and KEGG. Quality control, data pre-processing and normalization have been carried out to ensure the reliability of the data. 
&NewLine;
Currently, CyanoEXpress comprises expression data from 753 microarray measurements carried out in 33 independent studies. Additionally, we have started to include publicly available RNA-Seq data. Notably, changes in expression during both environmental and genetic perturbations are included in the integrated data set. In total, CyanoEXpress includes over distinct 197 expression entries for 3078 Synechocystis protein-coding genes. For RNA-seq data, expression data for non-coding genes are also available.
