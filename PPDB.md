# The Plant Proteome Database (PPDB)

> The main objective is to provide a centralized, curated, data deposit for predicted and experimentally determined proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana and maize (Zea mays), their annotated functions, as well as their experimental and predicted molecular and biophysical properties. Importantly, information from mass spectrometry-based identifications is available for each identified protein accession; this will allow the database user to determine the significance the experimental identification and also evaluate information of post-translational modification.
&NewLine;
Multiple search methods are provided so that the user can retrieve information based on gene identification number, functional annotation or various protein properties. Active links to other databases (e.g. TAIR and TIGR) are present.
