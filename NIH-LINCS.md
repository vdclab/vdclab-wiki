title: The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)
description: LINCS aims to create a network-based understanding of biology by cataloging changes in gene expression and other cellular processes that occur when cells are exposed to a variety of perturbing agents.

# The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS)

> The LINCS project is based on the premise that disrupting any one of the many steps of a given biological process will cause related changes in the molecular and cellular characteristics, behavior, and/or function of the cell – the observable composite of which is known as the cellular phenotype. Observing how and when a cell’s phenotype is altered by specific stressors can provide clues about the underlying mechanisms involved in perturbation and, ultimately, disease

## User Notes

- Data is derived from a wide variety of experiments performed on Eukaryotic (human) cell lines. 
- The gene search function gives you all experiments where the gene shows significant results, and provides a lot of extra information pertaining to each experiment (i.e. enrichments).
