# Open Targets Platform

> The Open Targets Platform integrates evidence from genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, drugs, animal models and scientific literature to score and rank target-disease associations for drug target identification. The associations are displayed in an intuitive user interface, and are available through a REST-API and a bulk download. In addition to target-disease associations, the Open Targets Platform also aggregates and displays data at the target and disease levels to aid target prioritisation.

## User Notes
- Most useful for genes/proteins with human homologs (of high disease relevance)
- Allows for easy search, browse and even the visualization of target-disease relationships
- It should be noted that figures/diagrams for entries are generated through queries of data maintained within the [Ensembl](https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html) and [Reactome](https://reactome.org) databases (relationships of these data are viewable through right click of a diagram as shown in your browser window and selection of "inspect" in the resultant dropdown menu; these objects are defined and links to data sources are listed within their respective containers)
 
## Ease of Use
- Very straight forward, easy-to-use/user-friendly
- Short/swift load times, mininal lag between tabs of entries, even those featuring visualizations of data
- Permits REST API access (data mining, computational, queries)
