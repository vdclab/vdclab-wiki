# Ensembl Bacteria

> The Ensembl genome annotation system, developed jointly by the EBI and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, has been used for the annotation, analysis and display of vertebrate genomes since 2000.
> 
> Since 2009, the Ensembl site has been complemented by the creation of five new sites, for bacteria, protists, fungi, plants and invertebrate metazoa, enabling users to use a single collection of (interactive and programatic) interfaces for accessing and comparing genome-scale data from species of scientific interest from across the taxonomy.
> 
> In each domain, we aim to bring the integrative power of Ensembl tools for comparative analysis, data mining and visualisation across genomes of scientific interest, working in collaboration with scientific communities to improve and deepen genome annotation and interpretation.

## User Notes

- Firefox is the recommonded browser for Ensembl
- If searching for a gene in a specific organism, it is much easier to load the organism database prior to searching. 
- Searching for gene names within an organism often results in empty results.  In order to find intended genes it may be more helpful to BLAST/BLAT search.
- Successful searches give a customizable search table, allowing users to choose which information columns they wish to display. 
- HMMER sequence feature/domain results provide accessions, family and clan IDs, descriptions, and cross-references (although some pages failed to load).
- They are promising a Non-redundant prokaryotic set that could be precious but not aavailable yet.

## Ease of Use

The site is not immediately intuitive and searches need to be carried out very specifically or through use of multiple search methods to ensure the intended data is acquired.
