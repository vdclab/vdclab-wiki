# Phylogenes

> PhyloGenes is a web resource that displays pre-computed phylogenetic trees of gene families alongside experimental gene function data to facilitate inference of unknown gene function in plants.
>
> Currently contains 40 plant species and 10 other non-plant model organisms.

## Notes from User
- Many difficulties with downloads: PNG download of tree does not work and SVG distorts tree; cannot download MSA offered; when downloading multiple gene families in one day, downloads each successive gene family to same file (so they appear at the bottom)
- References to experimental data are easy to use, input from GO annotations
- Not for phylogenetic queries
