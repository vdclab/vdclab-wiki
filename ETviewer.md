# ETviewer

> The Evolutionary Trace Viewer (ETV) provides a one-stop environment in which to run, visualize and interpret Evolutionary Trace (ET) predictions of functional sites in protein structures. ETV is implemented using Java to run across different operating systems using Java Web Start technology.

 ## Notes from User
 - Easy to use
 - Multiple input options
 - PDB are pre-computed, while UniPort or aa sequences are analysed on the spot, so they take some time
