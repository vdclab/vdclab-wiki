# Skolnick Lab Tools Suite

> The laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Skolnick is dedicated to systems and computational biology research and tool development. Through their suite of tools hosted by the Center for the Study of Systems Biology at Georgia Tech, the Skolnick group offers a diversity of resources and tools to aid researchers in their work. They provide many different tools that are useable either through webservers on their website or through downloadable softwares.

## User Notes
- Make take time for processing of request; it is best to perform these kinds of queries (prediction, modeling webservers) in advance of when their results are needed; prepare for any cases of server outages, backlogged queues, etc.
- Some server tools provide output via email in a plain text format: predicted likelihood of DNA binding per residue of a provided PDB structure (file or copy-pasted into text box of submission page)
