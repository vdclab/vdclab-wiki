# GNPS: Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking

> Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) is a web-based mass spectrometry ecosystem that aims to be an open-access knowledge base for community-wide organization and sharing of raw, processed or identified tandem mass (MS/MS) spectrometry data. GNPS aids in identification and discovery throughout the entire life cycle of data; from initial data acquisition/analysis to post publication.
>
> There are multiple analysis tools, advanced visualization tools, datasets, and data libraries available for users on the main page.  Each has its own link a devoted webpage and help information.

## User Notes

- Users must register a new account and login to analyze data. 
- To upload personal data you must install an FTP client if you don't already have one. 
- Users can create molecular networks of there metabolomics data.  The process is not simple, but detailed instructions are provided.
