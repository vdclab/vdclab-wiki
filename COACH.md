# COACH

> COACH is a meta-server approach to protein-ligand binding site prediction. Starting from given structure of target proteins, COACH will generate complementray ligand binding site predictions using two comparative methods, TM-SITE and S-SITE, which recognize ligand-binding templates from the BioLiP protein function database by binding-specific substructure and sequence profile comparisons. These predictions will be combined with results from other methods (including COFACTOR, FINDSITE and ConCavity to generate final ligand binding site predictions. 
&NewLine;
Users are also allowed to input primary sequence, where I-TASSER will be used to generate 3D models first which are then fed into the COACH pipeline for ligand-binding site prediction.

## Notes from Usres
- Downloadable verison.
- Cannot force a ligand to test, it's a blind search.

## Ease of use
- Input a PDB file or a protein sequence.
- Take some time to run.
