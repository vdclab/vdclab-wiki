# cons-PPISP

> ons-PPISP is a consensus neural network method for predicting protein-protein interaction sites. Given the structure of a protein, cons-PPISP will predict the residues that will likely form the binding site for another protein. The inputs to the neural network include position-specific sequence profiles and solvent accessibilities of each residue and its spatial neighbors. 
&NewLine;
The neural network is trained on known structures of protein-protein complexes. On a benchmark set of 22 protein complexes, cons-PPISP shows 71% prediction accuracy and 50% coverage of actual interface residues.
