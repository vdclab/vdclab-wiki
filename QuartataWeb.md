# QuartataWeb

> QuartataWeb is a user-friendly server developed for polypharmacological and chemogenomics analyses. Users can easily obtain information on experimentally verified (known) and computationally predicted (new) interactions between 5494 drugs and 2807 human proteins in DrugBank, and between 315 514 chemicals and 9457 human proteins in the STITCH database. 
>
> In addition, QuartataWeb links targets to KEGG pathways and GO annotations, completing the bridge from drugs/chemicals to function via protein targets and cellular pathways. It allows users to query a series of chemicals, drug combinations or multiple targets, to enable multi-drug, multi-target, multi-pathway analyses, toward facilitating the design of polypharmacological treatments for complex diseases.
