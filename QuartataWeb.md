# QuartataWeb

> QuartataWeb is a user-friendly server developed for polypharmacological and chemogenomics analyses. Users can easily obtain information on experimentally verified (known) and computationally predicted (new) interactions between 5494 drugs and 2807 human proteins in DrugBank, and between 315 514 chemicals and 9457 human proteins in the STITCH database. 
>
> In addition, QuartataWeb links targets to KEGG pathways and GO annotations, completing the bridge from drugs/chemicals to function via protein targets and cellular pathways. It allows users to query a series of chemicals, drug combinations or multiple targets, to enable multi-drug, multi-target, multi-pathway analyses, toward facilitating the design of polypharmacological treatments for complex diseases.

## User Notes
Information and, thereby, any query results are largely reliant upon published data being utilized by the resource, of which are primarily STITCH (another database-association network-building resource) or DrugBank, depending on the user's data source selection per query. Interpolation and generation of predicted interactions are determined with use of data from other resources, like PubChem, KEGG Pathways DB, and GO Annotations DB.

 
## Ease of Use
- Relatively straight-forward
- Knowledge or familiarity with specific compounds/drugs and proteins/genes may be necessary for optimal queries
- Search will still provide interaction results for a given drug, even if the queried protein/gene is not predicted to interact with said compound/agent; these kinds of results a preferred to a query simply resulted in an "error" page
