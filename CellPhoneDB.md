# CellPhoneDB

> CellPhoneDB is a publicly available repository of curated receptors, ligands and their interactions. Subunit architecture is included for both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. This is crucial, as cell-cell communication relies on multi-subunit protein complexes that go beyond the binary representation used in most databases and studies.
>
> CellPhoneDB integrates existing datasets that pertain to cellular communication and new manually reviewed information. CellPhoneDB utilises information from the following data bases: UniProt, Ensembl, PDB, the IMEx consortium, IUPHAR.
>
> CellPhoneDB can be used to search for a particular ligand/receptor or interrogate your own single-cell transcriptomics data.
