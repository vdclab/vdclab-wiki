# PI^2^PE

> PI^2^PE (Protein Interface/Interior Prediction Engine) consists of five predictors, developed by the Zhou group at FSU. Three of the predictors are based on position-specific sequence profiles, which are generated by running PSI-blast (blast release 2.2.13) on the non-redundant protein sequence database (nr; 3,625,149 entries; May 2006 release).
