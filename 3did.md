# 3did

> The database of three-dimensional interacting domains (3did) is a collection of high-resolution three-dimensional structural templates for domain-domain interactions. It contains templates for interactions between two globular domains as well as novel domain-peptide interactions, derived using a recently published method from our lab.

## Notes from the user
- The user can search for Domains or Motifs of interest and a network is quickly built for the query.
- Changing color schemes can quickly identify domain functions within the network.
- After the network is formed, binding partners can be selected and the interaction between the two is 3D modeled.
- Plenty of links and representative proteins are available for each domain.


## Ease of use

This tool is very easy to use, Query domains are auto filled and can recognize alternative names for domains. The networks are clean and clicking on nodes builds networks for the selected nodes.
