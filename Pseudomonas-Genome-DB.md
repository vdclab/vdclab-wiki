# Pseudomonas Genome Database

> The Pseudomonas Genome Database is well known for the application of community-based annotation approaches for producing a high-quality Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 genome annotation, and facilitating whole-genome comparative analyses with other Pseudomonas strains. To aid analysis of potentially thousands of complete and draft genome assemblies, this database and analysis platform integrates curated genome annotations and isolate metadata with enhanced tools for larger scale comparative analysis and visualization. Manually curated gene annotations are supplemented with improved computational analyses that help identify putative drug targets and vaccine candidates or assist with evolutionary studies by identifying orthologs, pathogen-associated genes and genomic islands. 
&NewLine;
The database schema has been updated to integrate isolate metadata that will facilitate more powerful analysis of genomes across datasets in the future. We continue to place an emphasis on providing high-quality updates to gene annotations through regular review of the scientific literature and using community-based approaches including a major new Pseudomonas community initiative for the assignment of high-quality gene ontology terms to genes. As we further expand from thousands of genomes, we plan to provide enhancements that will aid data visualization and analysis arising from whole-genome comparative studies including more pan-genome and population-based approaches.The Pseudomonas Genome Database website and PAO1 genome annotation are being continually updated with a focus on expanding functionality to facilitate accelerated discovery of P. aeruginosa drug targets, antibiotic resistance genes and vaccine candidates.

Originally developed by the Chiron Corporation in 1998 as part of the original Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 sequencing project, a team of researchers from Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia now manage the development.
