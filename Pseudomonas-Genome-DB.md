# Pseudomonas Genome Database

> The Pseudomonas Genome Database is well known for the application of community-based annotation approaches for producing a high-quality Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 genome annotation, and facilitating whole-genome comparative analyses with other Pseudomonas strains. To aid analysis of potentially thousands of complete and draft genome assemblies, this database and analysis platform integrates curated genome annotations and isolate metadata with enhanced tools for larger scale comparative analysis and visualization. Manually curated gene annotations are supplemented with improved computational analyses that help identify putative drug targets and vaccine candidates or assist with evolutionary studies by identifying orthologs, pathogen-associated genes and genomic islands.

## User Notes
 

- The gene/gene product search gives you a summary of all functional classifications/predictions, pathways, motifs, and sequences up and downstream of your query gene. 
- The database has no help page, but users can email with questions or comments (pseudocap-mail@sfu.ca).
- Good ortholog mapping tools between model Pseudomonas species
- Integrated Tn data
