# Seq2Ref

> Seq2Ref is designed to faciliate functional interpretation by retrieving and ranking the reference proteins in the BLAST result.

## Website

- [Seq2Ref *Main page*](http://prodata.swmed.edu/seq2ref/)

{.links-list}

## Notes from Users
This should be the first step to be done when working a new gene. It allows to extract papers on several members of a protein family. It is important however to check the links manually.

## Ease of Use
Enter your sequence, get litteraure! May sometimes be more usefull than text serch to know more about your protein of interest.
