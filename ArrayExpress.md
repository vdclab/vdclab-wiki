# ArrayExpress

> ArrayExpress is one of the repositories recommended by major scientific journals to archive functional genomics data from microarray and sequencing platforms to support reproducible research. To serve this mission we facilitate submissions in compliance with Minimum Information About A Microarray Experiment (MIAME) and Minimum Information About a Sequencing Experiment (MINSEQE) guidelines. Experiments are submitted directly to ArrayExpress or are imported from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database. For high-throughput sequencing based experiments the raw data is brokered to the European Nucleotide Archive, while the experiment descriptions and processed data are archived in ArrayExpress.
