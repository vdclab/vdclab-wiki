# Bioinformatic Course Modules

## BSC6459 - Introduction to Bioinformatics
### Module 0 - Start Here
Lorem ipsem

## MCB6318 - Comparative Microbial Genomics
### Module 0 - Start Here
Put whatever you want here to introduce the course material, but I feel like a list of resources, etc., would be redundant.

### Module 1 - Dealing with the Avalanche of Genomic Data
(insert diagram of workflow)
**Objective Summary**
- Extract and analyze bacterial genomes of interest 
- Extract sets of proteins/genes sequences of a specific family
- Find the literature associated with a protein family
- Map accession numbers from one database to another
- Reformat Fasta files using REGEX  tools


#### Extracting and Analyzing Bacterial Genomes

> Type of genomes, genome quality will vary per source. Some sources are better for some taxa than others. These and other factors are important when selecting a resource or multiple resources from which to extract genomes. Additionally, the total number of genomes being used should also be considered.

**JGI-IMG**
**NCBI Genome**
**MicroScope (GenoScope)**



#### Extracting Sets of Protein/Gene Sequences for a Target Family

**UniProt**
**NCBI Protein**
**NCBI Gene**

#### Finding Literature Pertaining to a Target Protein Family
(see broader [Literature Capture Workflow](link))

#### Mapping Accessions/Identifiers Between Different Source Databases

[**DAVID**](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/conversion.jsp)
[**UniProt Mapper**](https://www.uniprot.org/id-mapping)
(other mappers)

#### Reformatting FASTA Files Using REGEX Tools
> Registration of a RegExr user account is optimal, as this allows for saving and reuse of script templates to transform or convert different types of sequence headers. Resource also includes a reference and instructional materials for text expression rules, practices.

### Module 2 - Linking Gene and Function
(insert diagram of workflow)
**Objective Summary**
- Place an annotated gene in a biological context
- Check if a metabolic pathway is complete in a sequenced organism
- Visualize and compare pathway information in different databases
- Identify pathway holes
- Conduct phylogenetic distribution queries
- Analyze physical clustering

#### Placing Annotated Genes in Biological Context

#### Checking Metabolic Pathways for Completeness in Sequenced Organisms

#### Visualize and Compare Pathway Information Between Databases

#### Identifying Pathway Holes, Overlap, and Redundancy
(embed phylogenetic distribution, physical clustering strategies within this subsection?)

### Module 3 - Genome-wide Analysis of Experimental Data and Data Integration

(insert diagram of workflow)
**Objective Summary**
- Describe the overall process used to generate and analyze gene expression data
- Extract and analyze gene expression data from databases
- Predict and evaluate the presence of DNA binding sites for specific transcription factors
- Analyze Phenotype/Fitness data
- Map omics data to pathways

#### Gene Expression Data: Generation, Extraction, & Analysis
