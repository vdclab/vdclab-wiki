# Recommended Bioinformatic Workflows
## Protein Family-level Analysis
Lorem ipsem
## Model Organisms, Orthology as a Limited Predictor of Function
Lorem ipsem


# Bioinformatic Course Modules

## BSC6459 - Introduction to Bioinformatics
### Module 0 - Start Here
Lorem ipsem



## MCB6318 - Comparative Microbial Genomics
### Module 0 - Start Here
Lorem ipsem (put whatever you want here to introduce the course material, but I feel like a list of resources, etc., would be redundant)

### Module 1 - Dealing with the Avalanche of Genomic Data
**Objective Summary**
- Extract and analyze bacterial genomes of interest 
- Extract sets of proteins/genes sequences of a specific family
- Find the literature associated with a protein family
- Map accession numbers from one database to another
- Reformat Fasta files using REGEX  tools

#### Extracting and Analyzing Bacterial Genomes

> Type of genomes, genome quality will vary per source. Some sources are better for some taxa than others. These and other factors are important when selecting a resource or multiple resources from which to extract genomes. Additionally, the total number of genomes being used should also be considered.
