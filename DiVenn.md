# DiVenn

> Venn diagram is widely used to compare gene lists between multiple experiments. We aim to provide a web-based interactive tool DiVenn to help biologists visualize their gene list. Researchers can not only compare and visualize gene lists, but also integrate biological knowledge from public databases (KEGG and GO) to the graph. This tool is user-friendly and can handle large input data.
