## Notes from the user
 - Contains a wide variety of open source data from various organisms and experiment types
 - Data can be visualized/analyzed by the included analysis suite
 - Lots of ways to analyze data like sequence alignments, PCoA plots, heatmaps, etc...
 - Users can upload their own data to be used in the analysis suite
 
## Ease of use
> While the database portion of this website is simple enough to use, the analysis tool has a lot of depth and utility that users will need to get used to and learn how to use, but the potential for large data set analysis is worth the time.
