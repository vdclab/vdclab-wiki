# OrthoInspector

> OrthoInspector is a software suite for inference of orthologous relationships between protein coding-genes and an online resource to access and query precomputed orthology databases.
&NewLine;
On this website, they offer a catalog of predictions across the three domains of life. Precisely, predictions are available for proteins of 711 eukaryotes, 179 archaea and 3,863 bacteria (see Databases section for more information).
You can query the website using a Uniprot identifier or access, or using a BLAST similarity search with a protein sequence.
&NewLine;
Each protein page offers a fully searchable list of orthologs and inparalogs across multiple species as well as tools to investigate function and evolutionary history of the protein. You can also query the website using profiling tools.
