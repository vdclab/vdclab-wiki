# Seed Viewer: Plant SEED

> Plant SEED - the SEED was created to provide consistent and accurate genome annotations across thousands of genomes and as a platform for discovering and developing de novo annotations. The SEED is a constantly updated integration of genomic data with a genome database, web front end, API and server scripts.

## User Notes
Subsystem tools are useful for analysis of pathways within the context of genome features; essential for absense-presence analyses, comparisons of pathways and pathway conservation between taxa. This particular member of the PubSEED suite is dedicated to plant species and is far less useful for microbiologically relevant analyses.

## Ease of Use
Easy to use, although the website is a bit older and could use improvements to its database and interfaces.
