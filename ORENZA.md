# ORENZA : a database of ORphan ENZyme Activities

> Orphan enzyme activities correspond to the enzyme activities (EC numbers) defined by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB), and which are not associated with any amino acid sequences in the major public databases (i.e. UniProt, Enzyme, PDB, IntEnz, KEGG, BRENDA). These are cases of "missing genes" for known enzymes. 
ORENZA is a relational database of ORphan ENZyme Activities and this web site allows you to easily browse and search ORENZA.

## Notes from User
- Connects enzymes to KEGG Map, NCBI, Swiss-Prot, PDB, PubMed, BRENDA organisms
- Provides easy views to Orphan enzymes by activity, metabolism or EC classificationn
- Can report sequence evidence for enzymes here 
- not updated stuck in 2014.
