# ORENZA : a database of ORphan ENZyme Activities

> Orphan enzyme activities correpond to the enzyme activities (EC numbers) defined by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB), and which are not associated with any amino acid sequences in the major public databases (i.e. UniProt, Enzyme, PDB, IntEnz, KEGG, BRENDA).
