# Bioinformatics & Evolutionary Genomics Draw Venn Diagram

> With this tool you can calculate the intersection(s) of list of elements. It will generate a textual output indicating which elements are in each intersection or are unique to a certain list. If the number of lists is lower than 7 it will also produce a graphical output in the form of a venn/Euler diagram. You have the choice between symmetric (default) or non symmetric venn diagrams. Currently you are able to calculate the intersections of at maximum 30 lists.
The graphical output is produced in SVG and PNG format.
Downloading the figure in SVG format will allow you to further customise it with SVG compatible software such as for instance InkScape (which is freeware).
