# Metabolic network Analysis and Pathway Prediction Server (MAPPS)

> MAPPS is a web-based tool to study functions and evolution of metabolic networks using traditional and ‘omics data sets. 
>
> MAPPS provides diverse functionalities including an interactive interface, graphical visualization of results, pathway prediction and network comparison, identification of potential drug targets, in silico metabolic engineering, host–microbe interactions, and ancestral network building. 
>
> Importantly, MAPPS also allows users to upload custom data, thus enabling metabolic analyses on draft and custom genomes, and has an ‘omics pipeline to filter pathway results, making it relevant in today’s postgenomic era.
