# Pathfinder

> Pathfinder is a technique that provides visual methods to query paths, while considering various constraints. The resulting set of paths is visualized in both a ranked list and as a node-link diagram. For the paths in the list, we display rich attribute data associated with nodes and edges, and the node-link diagram provides topological context. The paths can be ranked based on topological properties, such as path length or average node degree, and scores derived from attribute data.
&NewLine;
Pathfinder is designed to scale to graphs with tens of thousands of nodes and edges by employing strategies such as incremental query results.
