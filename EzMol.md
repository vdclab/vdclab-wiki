# EzMol

> EzMol is a molecular visualization Web server in the form of a software wizard. It is designed for easy and rapid image manipulation and display of protein molecules, and is intended for users who need to quickly produce high-resolution images of protein molecules but do not have the time or inclination to use a software molecular visualization system.
>
> EzMol allows the upload of molecular structure files in PDB format to generate a Web page including a representation of the structure that the user can manipulate. EzMol provides intuitive options for chain display, adjusting the color/transparency of residues, side chains and protein surfaces, and for adding labels to residues. The final adjusted protein image can then be downloaded as a high-resolution image.

## User Notes

- Users can choose from a large range of colors for background and residues. 
- Residues, side chains and surfaces can be colored automatically by chemical (polar, aromatic, positively charged, etc) or by secondary structure types, or manually by the users.
- When viewing the protein chain, users can view the amino acids at each position as well as the secondary structure. 
- Rendered images can be exported as an image file or as a Chimera experimental instruction set.
- Note from developers: "When saving from the Safari browser, the image will be flipped vertically."

## Ease of Use

The tool is very easy to use.
