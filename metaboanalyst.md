# MetaboAnalyst

> MetaboAnalyst provides a free, efficient pipeline to support end-to-end analysis of liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) metabolomics data in a high-throughput manner. 
&NewLine;
LC-HRMS platforms are increasingly employed to comprehensively measure metabolome changes in systems biology and complex diseases. Over the past decade, several powerful computational pipelines have been developed for spectral processing, annotation, and analysis. However, significant obstacles remain with regard to parameter settings, computational efficiencies, batch effects, and functional interpretations. 
&NewLine;
MetaboAnalystR 4.0 is a significantly improved pipeline with three key new features: (1) efficient parameter optimization for peak picking; (2) automated batch effect correction; and (3) more accurate pathway activity prediction. Our benchmark studies showed that this workflow was 20~100Ã— faster compared to other well-established workflows and produced more biologically meaningful results. In summary, MetaboAnalystR offers an efficient pipeline to support high-throughput global metabolomics in the open-source R environment.

## User Notes

- The FAQ's page (see 'Help' section) is very useful and tabulated by analytical step. 
- The open-source R package is freely available at the GitHub repository.
- Detailed tutorials, manuals, example datasets, and R scripts are also included in the repository.
- MetaboAnalyst contains a set of 12 modular tools organized into four general categories; Exploratory statistical analysis, Functional enrichment analysis, Data integration & systems biology, and Data processing & utility functions.
- The metabolite ID conversion tool if very helpful when working with multiple sets of experimental data. 
- High quality figures produced by MetaboAnalyst can be downloaded for use and users can adjust color and marker options. 
- The R package can be downloaded for use on a personal computer or the entire analysis can be run on the MetaboAnalyst webserver (very quickly).

## Ease of Use

- This website is extremely easy to use and offers a wide range of helpful information, from tutorials to visuals of example input data based on the type of analysis to be performed.
