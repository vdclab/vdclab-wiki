# Genome2D

> Genome2D gives access to all publically available fully (no WGS) sequenced bacterial genomes of RefSeq and Genbank. In addition, all genomes are re-annotated to build a database of functional classes (COG, GO, KEGG, operons, keywords, Interpro, PFAM, etc.) which are used in transcriptome data analysis (RNA-Seq and DNA microarray). 
>
> Some data set transformations, such as reformatting DNA and Protein files, aligning tables, getting multiple DNA fragments, retrieving annotations of gene lists etc. are supported
{.is-info}

> Genome2D is a collection of resources and tools for genomics and transcriptomics analysis of prokaryotes. Users should take care to cite specific tools within Genome2D when appropriate.

## Notes from the user

- This webserver provides a collection of genome resources and genomics analysis tools. Users should take care to cite tools as appropriate.
- The server provides access to tools for RNA-Seq analysis as well as genomic regulatory analysis (predicting promoter, terminator, etc sequences).
 
## Ease of use

- The webserver is easy to use, providing access to analysis tools and resources. Tools without formal help pages have simple, detailed instructions.
