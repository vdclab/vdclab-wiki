## User Notes
 
- Using this search engine provided access to full, publish-format transcripts dated for release up to 5 months in the future. (i.e. a July 2020 search found papers to be published in October 2020)
- Users can generate citations from papers in their desired format.
- Keyword searches result in more inclusive results than author searches.  Some authors have several profiles (under the exact same name) with different H-indexes, publications and affiliated universities. 

## Ease of Use
 
- The search engine is very straight forward and produces impressive results for the most part.
