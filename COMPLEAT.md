# COMPLEAT

> COMPLEAT is an online tool used to analyze high-throughput datasets (or small-scale datasets) using protein complex enrichment analysis. The tool uses a protein complex resource as the backend annotation data instead of conventional Gene Ontology- or pathway-based annotations.
>
> With the input data, there is no need to pre-select for ‘hits’ from the study. Users can simply upload the full data set. Users can upload multiple datasets and quickly zoom in to view the complexes that are enriched in one or both datasets, as well as complexes enriched differentially between two datasets.

## Notes from the user
- Useful for selecting genes from complex data sets and forming networks from the identified genes
- Genes are automatically annotated when uploaded and are organized based on these annotations
- P-values are used to group genes that can be further analysed by the user

## Ease of use
> Using the tool is not difficult when using example data. Grouping genes is easy and exploring the resulting networks can be useful for finding interesting genes for certain biological processes. However, care should be taken when formatting data before uploading it to the tool.
