# COMPLEAT

> COMPLEAT is an online tool used to analyze high-throughput datasets (or small-scale datasets) using protein complex enrichment analysis. The tool uses a protein complex resource as the backend annotation data instead of conventional Gene Ontology- or pathway-based annotations.
>
> With the input data, there is no need to pre-select for ‘hits’ from the study. Users can simply upload the full data set. Users can upload multiple datasets and quickly zoom in to view the complexes that are enriched in one or both datasets, as well as complexes enriched differentially between two datasets.
