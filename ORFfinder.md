# ORFfinder

> ORF finder searches for open reading frames (ORFs) in the DNA sequence you enter. The program returns the range of each ORF, along with its protein translation. Use ORF finder to search newly sequenced DNA for potential protein encoding segments, verify predicted protein using newly developed SMART BLAST or regular BLASTP.
&NewLine;
This web version of the ORF finder is limited to the subrange of the query sequence up to 50 kb long.

## Notes from the user
- A great tool for annotating an unknown sequence
- Is compatible with a wide variety of organisms "genetic code"
- Uses the NCBI genome browser to look at the submitted sequence
- Identified ORFs can be blasted directly from the tool.

## Ease of use
> NCBI ORF finder should be among the first choices for identifying unknown protein encoding sequences. The tool accepts a variety of different inputs and has a couple of example sequences to help familiarize the user with the program. Results are simple and very visual but the integrated BLAST feature make the tool useful immediately for annotation.
