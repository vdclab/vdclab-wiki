# ORFfinder

> ORF finder searches for open reading frames (ORFs) in the DNA sequence you enter. The program returns the range of each ORF, along with its protein translation. Use ORF finder to search newly sequenced DNA for potential protein encoding segments, verify predicted protein using newly developed SMART BLAST or regular BLASTP.
&NewLine;
This web version of the ORF finder is limited to the subrange of the query sequence up to 50 kb long.
