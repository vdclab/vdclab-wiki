# NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

> The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is a public repository that archives and freely distributes comprehensive sets of microarray, next-generation sequencing, and other forms of high-throughput functional genomic data submitted by the scientific community. In addition to data storage, a collection of web-based interfaces and applications are available to help users query and download the studies and gene expression patterns stored in GEO.

## User Notes
- Large collection of datasets, but can sometimes be difficult or browser-unwieldy to use
- May sometimes be considered less than optimal in its user-friendliness
- Requires attention to export processes, data sources; requires familiarity with database ID/accession identification standards
