### Module 1 - Bioinformatics: definitions and database primer

**Module Objectives**
- Define bioinformatics and it uses in biology
- Present the use of databases in Biology
- Efficiently use Pubmed to find literature

> Bioinfornatics definition: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) gives a good summary in one sentence "Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field of science that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, especially when the data sets are large and complex". Modern biology has become a ["big data"](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/big.2020.0383) science and computational tools are needed to analyze  and make sense of all the different data types that are being generated.

#### Depositories of online resources for biologists
>[Biological databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_database) are libraries of biological sciences, collected from scientific experiments, published literature, high-throughput experiment technology, and computational analysis. Thye can be classified by the types of data the content, if they are primary data or curated , if they are general or specialized. The general Quality  and
