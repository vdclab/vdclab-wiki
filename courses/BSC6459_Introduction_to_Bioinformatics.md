# BSC64659 - Fundamentals of Bioinformatics
> general summary to write
{.is-info}

### Module 1 - Bioinformatics: definitions and database primer

**Module Objectives**
- Define bioinformatics and it uses in biology
- Present the use of databases in Biology and how to find them
- Efficiently use Pubmed to find literature

> Bioinfornatics definition: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) gives a good summary in one sentence "Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field of science that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, especially when the data sets are large and complex". Modern biology has become a ["big data"](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/big.2020.0383) science and computational tools are needed to analyze  and make sense of all the different data types that are being generated.

#### Online Bioinformatic courses
> Numerous online resources are available for learning bioinformatics. A few free resources are listed below.

#### Depositories of online resources for biologists
>[Biological databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_database) are libraries of biological sciences, collected from scientific experiments, published literature, high-throughput experiment technology, and computational analysis. They can be classified by  many different criteria such as the types of data they cover, if they are primary data or curated, if they are general or specialized. The quality of the database depends on how often they are updated, the curation effort that goes in to them or how well they respond to user feedback. The perinity of databases is an [issue](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/22/12523/6018434) as this requires long-term funding that is very difficult to secure.  Finding the best database to perform a task or access information is not easy a few staring points are listed below but generally, biologists have a set of databases they use on a regular basis for the majority of their tasks.

#### Searching biological literature with Pubmed
> Pubmed is one of the databases that almost all biologists use to search and access biomedical literature.  It is also a good starting point for beginners to learn the basics of database searches such as the use of boolean operators, issues with names and spelling, or the use of advanced search tools.
