# BSC64659 - Fundamentals of Bioinformatics
>  This course is an introduction to the basic bioinformatics tools used in computational biology for life science research. The course uses web-based resources that analyze gene and protein sequences as pertinent data examples. No programming skills are needed.
{.is-info}

**Student Learning Outcomes â€“ After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:**
1) Retrieve information on genes and proteins from biological and genomic databases.
2) Predict genes from DNA sequences.
3) Identify promoters and regulatory elements in DNA sequences
4) Analyze protein sequences
5) Compare protein and DNA sequences
6) Visualize and analyze protein structures
7) Construct and interpret simple phylogenies


### Module 1 - Bioinformatics: definitions and database primer

**Module Objectives**
- Define bioinformatics and it uses in biology
- Present the use of databases in Biology and how to find them
- Efficiently use Pubmed to find literature

> Bioinfornatics definition: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) gives a good summary in one sentence "Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field of science that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, especially when the data sets are large and complex". Modern biology has become a ["big data"](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/big.2020.0383) science and computational tools are needed to analyze  and make sense of all the different data types that are being generated.

#### Online Bioinformatic courses
> Numerous online resources are available for learning bioinformatics. A few free resources are listed below.

#### Depositories of online resources for biologists
>[Biological databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_database) are libraries of biological sciences, collected from scientific experiments, published literature, high-throughput experiment technology, and computational analysis. They can be classified by  many different criteria such as the types of data they cover, if they are primary data or curated, if they are general or specialized. The quality of the database depends on how often they are updated, the curation effort that goes in to them or how well they respond to user feedback. The perinity of databases is an [issue](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/22/12523/6018434) as this requires long-term funding that is very difficult to secure.  Finding the best database to perform a task or access information is not easy a few staring points are listed below but generally, biologists have a set of databases they use on a regular basis for the majority of their tasks.

- [**NAR database issue**](https://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/c/)


#### Searching biological literature with Pubmed
> Pubmed is one of the databases that almost all biologists use to search and access biomedical literature.  It is also a good starting point for beginners to learn the basics of database searches such as the use of boolean operators, issues with names and spelling, or the use of advanced search tools.

For users who want to explore other literature resources than Pubmed a few are listed in this [Wiki](https://vdclab-wiki.herokuapp.com/en/literature-search).


### Module 2 - Information retrieval

**Module Objectives**
- Navigate a GenBank or SwissProt entry  and explore other databases from these entries 
- Extract DNA and Protein sequences from NCBI based on different criteria 
- Design complex queries to identify groups of entries at NCBI  ( and other databases)
- Find the genes of a specific  metabolic pathway in a specific  organism

> Extracting protein/gene sequences from databases is not trivial. First, names are  not unique identifiers, mapping between different databases and/or objects is not well-done or intuitive.

#### Input and Output format
> The format of your input file is critical as most bioinformatic tools cannot deal with format errors. Tools to clan sequences up or convert one format to the other are therefore critical.
{.is-info}
- [**Sequence Massager**](https://vdclab-wiki.herokuapp.com/e/en/sequence-manipulation/changing-format/NA-Sequence-Massager) is used  to clean up nucleic acid sequences
- [ **EMBOSS Seqret**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/sfc/emboss_seqret) is used to change formats of sequences is part of the  [**Job Dispatcher**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/) platform provided by the EBI.
