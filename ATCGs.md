# ATGCs (Alignable Tight Genomic Clusters)

> ATGCs are a resource for micro- and macro-evolutionary studies of Bacteria and Archaea - in particular, pan-genomic studies of genes shared across multiple of these closely-related organisms. The major benefit of ATGCs is the large amount of pre-computed data, especially ATGC-COGs, multiple sequence alignments, and pairwise codeML evolutionary measurements. Examples include horizontal gene transfer (e.g., antibiotic resistance), gene neighborhood rearrangements (transposition, prophage integration), synonymous and nonsynonymous codon substitution models, phylogenetic inheritance, and many others

## Notes from users 
Each ATGC has the following properties:

**Alignable** => each organism shares >85% of its BLAST symmetric best-matches with at least one other organism in the same ATGC.
**Tight** => every organism in an ATGC is constrained to have synonymous substitution rate dS<1.5 in an ultrametric tree constructed from all the members in that ATGC.
**Genomic** => ATGCs are groupings of complete genomic assemblies (no partial assemblies allowed).
**Clusters** => ATGCs consist of â‰¥2 genome assemblies.

The ATGC list shows all the ATGCs available to view in the left column, along with additional data for each ATGC  to help identify ATGCs the user might want to study. The ATGC list can be downloaded as a CSV file and viewed in other programs.
