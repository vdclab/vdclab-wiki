# EmExplorer

> The preimplantation of mammalian embryos provide key insights into the question of when, where, and how cells take on fate separate. Understanding early development offers a striking opportunity for carry out further studies in cell reprograming or embryo development. 
&NewLine;
EmExplorer aims to provide an online analysis tool for search, browser and visualized of the developmental genes with its dynamic expression during different development stages.  
&NewLine;
The current version of EmExplorer documents more than 158,000 items that contain more than 32,000 development-related genes under 306 related pathways across five mammal species.

## Notes from the user

- Users can make expression comparisons for one specific gene or functional pathway between different species by using the online tool. 
- EmExplorer is helpful for elucidating early developmental mechanisms and exploring time activation genes.
- Several pathways available for analysis have no associated data (i.e. can't be analyzed).

## Ease of use

- The site is well designed and easy to use. The help page has tutorial-like instructions with included videos.
