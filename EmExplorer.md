# EmExplorer

> EmExplorer is a database for exploring time activation of gene expression in mammalian embryos, which also .systematically organizes the genes from development-related pathways
>
>The current version of EmExplorer incorporates over 26 000 genes obtained from 306 functional pathways in five species. The function annotations of development-related genes were also integrated into EmExplorer.
>
> EmExplorer is helpful for elucidating early developmental mechanisms and exploring time activation genes.
