# NetGO

> NetGO is a web server that is able to further improve the performance of the large-scale AFP by incorporating massive protein-protein network information. Specifically, the advantages of NetGO are threefold in using network information: 
(i) NetGO relies on a powerful learning to rank framework from machine learning to effectively integrate both sequence and network information of proteins
(ii) NetGO uses the massive network information of all species (>2000) in STRING (other than only some specific species) 
(iii) NetGO still can use network information to annotate a protein by homology transfer, even if it is not contained in STRING.

## User Notes
 - Generates machine learning-driven protein-protein interaction network and ontology network builds using homology, network database information and annotation data (traditional precautions advised for the use of inferences or associations generated using second-hand or aggregated data)
 - Provides visualizations of query outputs; permits for data export
