# NetGO

> NetGO is a web server that is able to further improve the performance of the large-scale AFP by incorporating massive protein-protein network information. Specifically, the advantages of NetGO are threefold in using network information: 
(i) NetGO relies on a powerful learning to rank framework from machine learning to effectively integrate both sequence and network information of proteins
(ii) NetGO uses the massive network information of all species (>2000) in STRING (other than only some specific species) 
(iii) NetGO still can use network information to annotate a protein by homology transfer, even if it is not contained in STRING.
