# Caleydo

> Caleydo is a community of researchers at JKU Linz, the University of Utah, and Harvard Medical School that focuses on biological data visualization. Caleydo used to be a monolithic visual analysis framework originally developed at TU Graz, targeted at biomolecular data, but has since evolved into a more distributed collection of people, tools, software, and research projects. Some of the tools developed as part of the Caleydo framework are now maintained and extended by our spin-off company, datavisyn.
