# AnnoTree

> AnnoTree is a web tool for visualization of genome annotations across large phylogenetic trees. AnnoTree version 1.2 includes KEGG, Pfam and Tigrfam annotations for over 27,000 bacterial and 1500 archaeal genomes. Phylogenetic and taxonomy information is derived from the GTDB database (Release RS89).
&NewLine;
Future releases will include additional types of functional annotations and expand the phylogenomic framework to Eukaryotes.

## Notes from Users
Be sure to have the Id numbers you need. This tool doesn't show the distribution per protein, but just each branch that have all of the a member of the family queried. The results are really dependent on the family chosen . Some pfam are really broad and this is not very useful. KO families are usually more specific. Very useful also to agther statistics and all proteins of a given family
You can't have the full tree of life, it is only either Bacteria or Archaea.

## Ease of use
Fairly easy to get an image of distribution on the tree of life.
