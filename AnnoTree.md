# AnnoTree

> AnnoTree is a web tool for visualization of genome annotations across large phylogenetic trees. AnnoTree version 1.2 includes KEGG, Pfam and Tigrfam annotations for over 27,000 bacterial and 1500 archaeal genomes. Phylogenetic and taxonomy information is derived from the GTDB database (Release RS89).
&NewLine;
Future releases will include additional types of functional annotations and expand the phylogenomic framework to Eukaryotes.
