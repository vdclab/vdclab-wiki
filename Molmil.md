# Molmil Viewer

> We have developed a new platform-independent web-based molecular viewer using JavaScript and WebGL. The molecular viewer, Molmil, has been integrated into several services offered by Protein Data Bank Japan and can be easily extended with new functionality by third party developers. Furthermore, the viewer can be used to load files in various formats from the userâ€™s local hard drive without uploading the data to a server.

## Notes from the user
- A great tool for viewing protein structures but limited for analysis
- Can use files from the protein databank by entering the desired protein's ID
- lots of customization on residue color and model type

## Ease of use

This protein modeling tool is easy to use if the user is familiar with other protein modeling software. Some features are hidden (like the amino acid sequence) and require some trial and error to find. Not ideal for analyzing multiple protein structures.
