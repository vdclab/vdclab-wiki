# Molmil Viewer

> We have developed a new platform-independent web-based molecular viewer using JavaScript and WebGL. The molecular viewer, Molmil, has been integrated into several services offered by Protein Data Bank Japan and can be easily extended with new functionality by third party developers. Furthermore, the viewer can be used to load files in various formats from the userâ€™s local hard drive without uploading the data to a server.
