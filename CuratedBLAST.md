# Curated BLAST

> Curated BLAST finds curated proteins whose descriptions match the query and uses ublast to compare these to the annotated proteins in the genome. Then, it uses ublast to compare the curated proteins to all possible proteins in the genome (the six-frame translation)

## Notes from Users
This is an advanced anotation tool. It does not just look at the best match to annotate but also replace the annotation in metabolic pathway contexts.Can also be used to find a gene in a genome when not much information is available.
