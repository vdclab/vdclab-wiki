# ModelSEED

> ModelSEED is a resource for the reconstruction, exploration, comparison, and analysis of metabolic models.
{.is-info}

## Notes from user
- Forms theoretical models of metabolic states of organisms, given a user specified media.
- Good for finding genes involved with metabolism of a specified nutrient.
- Model SEED can also be run through the PATRIC platform.


## Ease of use
> Generating a model is simple, just select an organism and a media. Great visualization of metabolic pathways.
