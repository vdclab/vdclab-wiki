# The ConSurf Server

> The ConSurf server (Glaser et al., 2003; Landau et al., 2005; Ashkenazy et al., 2010; Celniker et al., 2013; Ashkenazy et al., 2016) is a bioinformatics tool for estimating the evolutionary conservation of amino/nucleic acid positions in a protein/DNA/RNA molecule based on the phylogenetic relations between homologous sequences.

## Notes from User
- Can manually select evolutionary model or ConSurf will automatically pick best model
- Gives multiple, easy to use viewers of structural results as well as MSA (which ConSurf can generate or you can input)
- Also generates phylogenetic tree used 
- For both protein and RNA structures
