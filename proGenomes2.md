# ProGenomes 2

> proGenomes2 provides 87,920 consistently annotated bacterial and archaeal genomes from over 12000 species. These can be interactively explored and downloaded, whereby subsets can be customized e.g. taxonomic clades, representatives of each species or habitat-specific subsets. For each species cluster, precomputed pangenomes are available.
