# MetNetDB

> The MetNet database (MetNetDB) contains information on networks of metabolic and regulatory and interactions in Arabidopsis. This information is based on input from biologists in their area of expertise. In addition to the MetNet-curated interactions, we provide Aracyc-curated pathways and AGRIS-curated regulatory network. The data in MetNetDB is updated regularly. 
&NewLine;
Types of interactions in MetNetDB include transcription, translation, protein modification, assembly, allosteric regulation, translocation from one subcellular compartment to another. Other fields describing the interactions are subcellular location, confidence, directionality, references, evidence, and synonyms. Data on entities (DNA, RNA, polypeptides, protein complexes, metabolites) are derived from web databases (gene related databases: TAIR, GO, MapMan/GabiPD; protein related databases: PPDB, AMPDB, AtNoPDB, AraPerox, PLprot, BRENDA; metabolite related databases: ChEBI, PubChem, KEGG, NCI compound library, NIST MS library), in some cases with additional annotation by experts.

## User Notes
- Users may experience minor navigation obstacles when dealing with the website, itself ("Home" is less than ideal in its accessibility as you navigate to specific tools; back button or use of additional tabs is recommended)
- Popular for its MetaVenn tool which can be used to generate venn diagrams for various types of tabular biological data
