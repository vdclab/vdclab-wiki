## User Notes

- ESPript input is a MSA file. Many of the supported MSA format types are interfaced with ESPript (ex: MultAlin), making an easy transition between tools.  
- PyMOL is required for users to take advantage of the interactive representations.
- Making figures is most effective when using ESPript alongside ENDscript.
- ESPript is not able to predict protein secondary structures (it only uses experimentally determined structures), but users can include additional files depicting secondary structures.
- Results are displayed in a pop-up window, so users must ensure their results pop-up window isn't blocked by their browsers.

## Ease of Use

ESPript 3.0 is easy to use and has extensive tutorials and user guides.
