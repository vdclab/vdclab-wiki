# Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI)

> This website contains a collection of webtools for creating and interacting with sequence similarity networks (SSNs) and genome neighborhood networks (GNNs). These tools originated in the Enzyme Function Initiative, a NIH-funded research project to develop a sequence / structure-based strategy for facilitating discovery of in vitro enzymatic and in vivo metabolic / physiological functions of unknown enzymes discovered in genome projects.

## Ease of Use
> There are well written descriptions/explanations and tutorials making the tools easy to use. Users are also able to email for help, reporting issues, or suggestions.

## User Notes
- In order to view and analyze your SSN or GNNs you will need to download Cytoscape.  The EFI Help and YouTube links (below) have tips/tutorials for using Cytoscape effectively. 
- When using the Gene Neighborhood Tool (GNT), SSNs generated from FASTA sequences (option C) without the "Read Header" option activated are not accepted.
- Prior to generating a GNN, it's beneficial to edit your input SSN by removing singlets and nodes in clusters of fewer than 6. 
- If you want both a colored SSN and a GNN, running the GNT with an un-colored SSN will output both. 
- Use the Tutorial tabs provided for each tool, they're very helpful.
