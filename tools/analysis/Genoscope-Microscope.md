# Genoscope - Microscope

> MicroScope offers many useful data-exploring functionalities, such as allowing users to perform (complex) queries, comparative genomic studies, and metabolic analyses. It also provides summary views of statistics and information for each genome as a whole.
&NewLine;
The MicroScope web interface (MaGe, for « Magnifying Genomes » ) has been specifically designed to assist curators in the evaluation of all available data needed for assigning the best possible annotation to a given gene product.

## Notes from User
- One of the best platform for genome annotation of microbial genome
- Metabolic reconstruction tools
- Complex searches are very elaborate but not intuitive 
- RNA-seq analysis available but with a few weeks work around
- Integrates a lot of cool tools for pathogenecity islands or pangenomes
- Only a subset of microbial genomes is available 
- Limited set of genomes but I think it is the best integarted platform to annoate a microbial genomes for an "annoation group" 
- Many intergrated tools for comparative genomics such as AntoSmash, Or pathogenicity island finders   and  and also some unique features like minimal and pangenomes sets. 

## Ease of Use
- Things can get complicated as many windows open
- Java issues make it sometimes very fustrating. 
- Making the patwhays tools linked to BioCyc is also tricky as the if you have not looded the genome a few days ahaead they do not work .
