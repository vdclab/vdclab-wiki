# ViennaRNA

> The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure related computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model, the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs.
>
> New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format.

## User Notes

- Users need to download and install the software for use. 
- The package offers the ability to perform very thorough analyses of RNA molecules of interest. 

## Ease of Use

- As the package must be downloaded and installed for use, ViennaRNA is easier to use with prior programming experience. The help tutorial provides very well written, detailed instructions simplifying use for those without prior experience.
