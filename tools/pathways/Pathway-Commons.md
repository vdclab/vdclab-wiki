# Pathway Commons

> Pathway Commons aims to collect and disseminate biological pathway and interaction data. Data is collected from partner databases and is represented in the BioPAX standard. By representing data in BioPAX, Pathway Commons is able to provide a detailed representation of a variety of biological concepts including: Biochemical reactions; gene regulatory networks; and genetic interactions; transport and catalysis events; and physical interactions involving proteins, DNA, RNA and small molecules and complexes.

## Notes from User
- Important to read citation to accurately use tool 
- Pathway guide gives step by step process and analysis of RNA-seq to enrichment, any other protocol may need modifications from this
- Stated it can be used across all organisms 
- Alternatively, can search gene or pathway to find pathways aggregated from PANTHER, KEGG, many more
