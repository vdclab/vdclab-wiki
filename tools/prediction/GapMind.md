# GapMind

> GapMind is a Web-based tool for annotating amino acid biosynthesis in bacteria and archaea. GapMind incorporates many variant pathways and 130 different reactions, and it analyzes a genome in just 15â€‰s. To avoid error-prone transitive annotations, GapMind relies primarily on a database of experimentally characterized proteins. GapMind correctly handles fusion proteins and split proteins, which often cause errors for best-hit approaches

 ## Ease of Use
 
 - This webtool is self-explanatory and very easy to use.
 
 ## User Notes
 
 - GapMind finds gaps in the biosynthesis pathway of 17 canonical amino acids and chorismate (aromatic amino acid precursor) and predicts enzymes that are likely to fill the. pathway, with differing confidence scores.
- GapMind is well adept to analyze fusion and split proteins. 
- In order for the tool to run successfully, the organism must have a published protein fasta file (predicted proteins from the genome). 
- Users can analyze their organism of interest by searching for it in NCBI assemblies, MicrobesOnline genomes, Fitness Browser genomes, Uniprot proteomes, or JGI/IMG genomes. 
- This tool would be very helpful to users working with non-model organisms.

 ## Help
- GapMind has no formal help page, but the home page has sufficient instructions. 
- Price, et al. (2020) also gives helpful advice for use of GapMind.
