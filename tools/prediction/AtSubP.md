# AtSubP

> AtSubP (for Arabidopsis subcellular localization predictor) is based on the combinatorial presence of diverse protein features, such as its amino acid composition, sequence-order effects, terminal information, Position-Specific Scoring Matrix, and similarity search-based Position-Specific Iterated-Basic Local Alignment Search Tool information (PSI-BLAST).
