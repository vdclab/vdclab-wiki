# Genome3D

> Genome3D is a collaborative project that provides predictions of structural features for sequences from a number of model genomes (currently human, E-coli and baker's yeast). Since the resource combines annotations from a number of independent resources, the consensus picture that builds up can often be more informative than the individual predictions alone.
&NewLine;
The Genome3D project brings together a number of leading UK structure-based prediction resources. It incorporates the structural classification resources SCOP and CATH to provide consensus information on 3D structures of genomic sequences. Genome3D is currently funded by the BBSRC.
