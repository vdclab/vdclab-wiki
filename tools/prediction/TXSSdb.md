# MacSyDB/TXSSdb

> Protein secretion systems are key virulence factors of all major bacterial pathogens with an LPS-containing outer membrane. They are also involved in complex antagonistic ecological interactions between bacteria. We designed models and protein profiles to detect an unprecedented number and diversity (∼10000) of bacterial protein secretion systems (T1SS, T2SS, T3SS, T4SS, T5SS, T6SSi-iii, T9SS) and evolutionarily related appendages (T4P, Tad, Flagellum) in 1528 genomes of diderm bacteria.

## Notes from the user
 
- This site scans a genome of interest to detect potential secretion systems.
- Users can search by taxon id (taxid), replicon NCBI id (NCBI IC) or name, taxonomy or a specific strain. Users can also specify the type of system they are searching for. 
- The website gives you instant search results (no submitting). Clicking on the desired result brings the users to it's specific information page. 
- Users can use the webserver version of the tool or download and install the software on a personal computer. 
 
## Ease of use
