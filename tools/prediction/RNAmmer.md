## Website 

- [RNAmmer *Main Page*](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/RNAmmer/)

 ## Notes from the user
- Able to identify rRNA sequences from Bacteria, Archaea, or Eukaryotes

 
 ## Ease of use

A simple tool that does what it claims. The results are not easy to read and only identify the nucleotides where the rRNA feature begins and ends.
