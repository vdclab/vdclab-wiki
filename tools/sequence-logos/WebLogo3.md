# WebLogo 3

> A sequence logo is a graphical representation of an amino acid or nucleic acid multiple sequence alignment and is a useful way to visualize and present consensus sequences. In general, a sequence logo provides a richer and more precise description of, for example, a binding site, than an ordinary consensus sequence would.
&NewLine;
WebLogo is a web-based application designed to take multiple sequence alignments and generate a graphical representation of the consensus sequence (i.e. the sequence logo).

## User Notes
- WebLogo is a web-based application, but users can also download the source code. 
-  If you need to create large numbers of logos, you are welcome to download the code and run WebLogo on your own machine. *If a request flood compromises the WebLogo server,  your IP address will be unceremoniously blocked.*

## Ease of Use
-  WebLogo is easy to use. If uncertain, use the WebLogo users manual (below) to set/fine-tune parameters.
-  Remember to use an alignment and not sequences as input.
