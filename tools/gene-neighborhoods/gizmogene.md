# GizmoGene

> Per the GizmoGene homepage: "GizmoGene is an independent service that extends functionality provided by PATRIC bioinformatic resource center (https://patricbrc.org).
>
>PATRIC maintains an enormous collection of publicly available microbial genomes (over half a million), supports annotation of usersâ€™ own private genomes, and provides helpful tools to build user-defined genome groups.
>
>Currently, user-defined genome groups cannot be utilized in PATRIC Compare Region display, a powerful tool of comparative genome analysis supporting gene discovery, functional predictions, and genome annotation.
>
>Complementing PATRIC capabilities, GizmoGene allows user to choose any microbial genomes defined in PATRIC (public or private) to generate Compare Region-like display with additional helpful information."
