# CAGECAT

> For sequence-based searches for homologous gene clusters and for generating publication quality gene neighborhood figures.

## User Notes
 
 - Homologous gene cluster search takes a number of sequence-based inputs including HMM identifiers
 - Taxonomic ranges, genomes can be selected (only restricted by genome source databases, i.e., NCBI)

 
## Ease of use

- webserver outputs can sometimes be graphically unwieldy for browsers if too many genomes are selected; such limitations make this tool better for precise or predetermined outputs, not so much for exploratory analyses
