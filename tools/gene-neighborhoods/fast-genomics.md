# fast.genomics

> Sequence-based gene neighborhood search tool. Also one of few sequence-based tools that allow for examining pairs of families and their respective co-occurrence. As the website describes: "Once the homologs are identified, fast.genomics can quickly show:
> --Gene neighborhoods
> --Which taxa contain homologs
> --Compare the presence/absence of two proteins
> --See which taxa have two genes nearby"
