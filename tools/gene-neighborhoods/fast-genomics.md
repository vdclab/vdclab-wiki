# fast.genomics

> Sequence-based gene neighborhood search tool. Also one of few sequence-based tools that allow for examining pairs of families and their respective co-occurrence. As the website describes: "Once the homologs are identified, fast.genomics can quickly show:
> --Gene neighborhoods
> --Which taxa contain homologs
> --Compare the presence/absence of two proteins
> --See which taxa have two genes nearby"

## User Notes
 
 - Useful for fast analysis of gene neighborhoods among bacteria.
 - Query of two families requires two independent runs of the sequence-based submission within the same browser window; these queries are then useable in a subsequent two-family analysis.

 
## Ease of use

- Most of the outputs are exportable as either tables and/or svg files (the latter if the output is graphical)
