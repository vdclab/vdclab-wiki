# COGNAT

> One of the online resources produced by the team at the National Depository Bank of Live Systems of Moscow State University. Useful for quick observations of gene neighborhoods across select subsets of taxa; includes highlight of at least one frequently co-occurring neighbor (COG).

## User Notes
 
 - Very useful for "quick-look" level queries for preliminary investigations
 - While it is not clear whether a login is required (or if the link text is resultant of a mistranslation), a link with the text "Log Out" is located at the top right; it is unclear what this implies re. the longevity of the tool (ca. Dec. 2023)

 
## Ease of use

- Exports are very limited; tabular export is not clearly provided, nor is a FTP to source the data known
- Tool's domain/protein family identification is limited to COG annotation-dependent methods
