# Interactive Pathways Explorer (iPath3)

> iPath provides extensive map customization and data mapping capablities. Colors, width and opacity of any map element can be changed using various types of data (for example KEGG KOs, COGs or EC numbers). All maps in iPath can be easily converted to various bitmap and vector graphical formats for easy inclusion in your documents or further processing.

## User Notes

- Users can visualize the presence/absence of KEGG KOs between two species using the "Species comparison" tool.
- There are four basic iPath pathway maps to choose from. They are derived from KEGG pathways, but are much more visually appealing. 
- Customization of the maps is available only for visualization aspects, the pathways within the maps cannot be editted.

## Ease of Use

- The site is fairly straight forward and the help pages and video tutorials make iPath3 easy to use.
