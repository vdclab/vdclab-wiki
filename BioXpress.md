# BioXpress

> BioXpress is a database for differential expression in cancer where RNA-seq and miRNA-seq derived read counts have been analyzed for differential expression. The current version of BioXpress includes mRNA-derived expression from TCGA, and miRNA-derived expression from TCGA and ICGC.

## Notes from the user

- There is no formal help page for this site, but it works through the High-performace Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) Lab repository.
- Creating a HIVE Lab account gives user access to additional tools and resources. 
- BioXpress searches are similar to those of OncoMX (also a HIVE Lab resource), but gives additional information and transcriptomic data. 
- The HIVE Lab resources are complementary to one another. 

## Ease of use

- The website is straight forward and easy to use, but has no formal help page.  Creating a HIVE Lab account would be useful for those focusing on cancer research.
