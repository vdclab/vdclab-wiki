Joint Genome Institute Expert Review Data Submission

> The Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M) system serves as a community resource for comparative analysis and annotation of all publicly available genomes from three domains of life, in a uniquely integrated context. 
&NewLine;
IMG/M provides tools for analyzing the functional capability of microbial communities based on their metagenome sequence, in the context of reference isolate genomes included from the IMG/M system. IMG Expert Review (IMG/ER) provides support to individual scientists or groups of scientists for functional annotation and curation of microbial genomes of interest, usually prior to their release to Genbank.
