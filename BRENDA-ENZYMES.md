# BRENDA ENZYMES

> The BRENDA enzyme database, recently appointed ELIXIR Core Data Resource, is the main enzyme and enzyme-ligand information system. The core database provides a comprehensive overview on enzymes. A collection of 4.3 million data for ∼84 000 enzymes manually evaluated and extracted from ∼140 000 primary literature references is combined with information obtained by text and data mining, data integration and prediction algorithms. Supplements comprise disease-related data, protein sequences, 3D structures, predicted enzyme locations and genome annotations.
