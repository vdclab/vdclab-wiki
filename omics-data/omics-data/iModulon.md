# iModulon

> Welcome to iModulonDB! This is a web-based tool for accessing a database of transcriptomic dataset decompositions. If you are a biologist interested in what machine learning can tell us about the regulation of bacterial gene expression, this site will provide very valuable tools for you.  See General introduction on the iModulon [Intro link}(https://imodulondb.org/about.html)
