# EMBL-EBI MetaboLights

> MetaboLights is a database for Metabolomics experiments and derived information. The database is cross-species, cross-technique and covers metabolite structures and their reference spectra as well as their biological roles, locations and concentrations, and experimental data from metabolic experiments. MetaboLights is the recommended Metabolomics repository for a number of leading journals.
&NewLine;
MetaboLights offers user-submission tools and has strong reporting capabilities. MetaboLights uses and further develops de-facto standard formats where various components are encapsulated, such as the encoded spectral and chromatographic data, and associated information about the chemical structure, as well as metadata describing assays and the study as a whole.
&NewLine;
MetaboLights semantic quality is based on various controlled vocabularies and ontologies linking data to existing resources such as BRENDA.

## User Notes

- Users can use platform to share private/unpublished data bewtween collaborators and peer reviewers.
- Many studies found in the database have useful protocols available. (Sample collection, Metabolite extraction, Chromatography, Mass spectrometry, Data transformation, Metabolite identification, ect.)
- Structures, chemical formulas, chemical properties, and database-specific metabolite identifiers can be found for each metabolite. 
- Data can be downloaded directly from the details page of the study in which it as produced. 

## Ease of Use
- The website is easy to use, but easier and more useful if you are searching for specific information versus browsing. 
- There are well written, detailed instructions for submitting your published metabolomics data.
