> High-resolution analysis of the pneumococcal transcriptome under a wide range of infection-relevant conditions. 
> 	The expression and regulation of pneumococcal genes at different life-cycle stages, such as commensal or pathogenic, are not entirely understood. To chart the transcriptional responses of S. pneumoniae, we used RNA-seq to quantify the relative abundance of the transcriptome under 22 different infection-relevant conditions. The data demonstrated a high level of dynamic expression and, strikingly, all annotated pneumococcal genomic features were expressed in at least one of the studied conditions. By computing the correlation values of every pair of genes across all studied conditions, we created a co-expression matrix that provides valuable information on both operon structure and regulatory processes.

 ## Notes from the user
 - This database is specific for Streptococcus pneumoniae gene expression data under a set of 22 different conditions.
 - User will need to know their list of genes prior to accessing the database.
 - There is some customization of the data visualization from the tool but download links for the raw data are available in Excel formats for full user customization.

 
 ## Ease of use

This database is a great resource for researchers interested in studying gene expression in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The conditions offered by the database are focused on mimicking host conditions but there are some datasets from in vitro studies. The gene search bar is helpful for translating gene name with locus tag so that users can quickly find their genes of interest.
