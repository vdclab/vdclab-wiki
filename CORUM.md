# CORUM

> The CORUM database provides a resource of manually annotated protein complexes from mammalian organisms. Annotation includes protein complex function, localization, subunit composition, literature references and more. All information is obtained from individual experiments published in scientific articles, data from high-throughput experiments is excluded.

## Website

- [CORUM *Main Page*](http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/corum/)

## User Notes
- Less useful for microbial research unless strictly for comparative purposes when discusses conserved proteins
- Visual appearance of the site may glitch (e.g., the header) for some browsers

## Ease of Use
Relatively straightforward, but may require some knowledge of protein complexes prior to using the search tool or browser.
