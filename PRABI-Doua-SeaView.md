# PRABI-Doua: SeaView

> SeaView is a graphical multiple sequence alignment editor developped by Manolo Gouy. SeaView is able to read and write various alignment formats (NEXUS, MSF, CLUSTAL, FASTA, PHYLIP, MASE). It allows to manually edit the alignment, and also to run DOT-PLOT or CLUSTALW/MUSCLE programs to locally improve the alignment.
