# Protein Structure Prediction Center

> Our goal is to help advance the methods of identifying protein structure from sequence. The Center has been organized to provide the means of objective testing of these methods via the process of blind prediction. The Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments aim at establishing the current state of the art in protein structure prediction, identifying what progress has been made, and highlighting where future effort may be most productively focused.

## Notes from User
- Important to check here which prediction tool is the best.
- One CAPS experiment every 2 years since 1994.
