# EDGAR - A software platform for comparative genomics
>EDGAR (Efficient Database framework for comparative Genome Analyses using BLAST score Ratios) is designed to automatically perform genome comparisons in a high throughput approach. Comparative analyses for 2160 genomes across 167 genus groups taken from the NCBI genomes database were conducted with the software and the results were integrated into an underlying database. EDGAR provides novel analysis features and significantly simplifies the comparative analysis of related genomes. The software supports a quick survey of evolutionary relationships and simplifies the process of obtaining new biological insights into the differential gene content of kindred genomes. Visualization features, like synteny plots or Venn diagrams, are offered to the scientific community through a web-based and therefore platform independent user interface, where the precomputed data sets can be browsed. EDGAR is used for comparative genome analyses, e.g. to compute the core genome, the pangenome, singleton genes, synteny plots, and Venn diagrams.
