# TRee-based Exploration of Neighborhoods and Domains (TREND)

> TREND has the capability to automatically identify protein features, calculate gene neighborhoods of each gene corresponding to provided prokaryotic proteins, cluster neighboring genes, identify operons, and put all these data in a phylogenetic context. 
>
> TREND is the only resource that can calculate gene neighborhoods for more than 125 000 prokaryotic genomes, identify protein features and correlate this with phylogeny in automated fashion, while providing ample opportunities for adjusting each step of the analysis.

## Notes from User
- Different formats to export results.
- Good tool to get a lot of info in a short amount of time.
- Not sure about the limit of protein number you can input.
 
## Ease of use
#### Domain Analysis Tool
- Several input possible (fatsa, list of Ids, Newick Tree, alignments). See help section.
- Set up your alignment preferences and tree preferences. Set up your protein preferences.
- Get a tree of your protein of interest plus the domain analysis of each protein.
#### Neighborhood Analysis Tool
- Several input possible (fatsa, list of Ids, Newick Tree, alignments). See help section.
- Set up your alignment preferences and tree preferences. Set up your neighborhood preferences.
- Get a tree of your protein of interest plus the neighborhood, all colored by homologies.
