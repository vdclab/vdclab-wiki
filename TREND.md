# TRee-based Exploration of Neighborhoods and Domains (TREND)

> TREND has the capability to automatically identify protein features, calculate gene neighborhoods of each gene corresponding to provided prokaryotic proteins, cluster neighboring genes, identify operons, and put all these data in a phylogenetic context. 
>
> TREND is the only resource that can calculate gene neighborhoods for more than 125 000 prokaryotic genomes, identify protein features and correlate this with phylogeny in automated fashion, while providing ample opportunities for adjusting each step of the analysis.
