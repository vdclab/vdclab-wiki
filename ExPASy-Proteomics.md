# ExPASy Proteomics

> In June 2011 the SIB ExPASy Bioformatics Resources Portal was launched by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. In particular, ExPASy has been designed, developed and maintained by the SIB Web Team in co-operation with several other SIB groups and ExPASy users. ExPASy is an extensible and integrative portal accessing many scientific resources, databases and software tools in different areas of life sciences. Refer to Features for more details. The portal enhances the original ExPASy server, previously known as "Expert Protein Analysis System"
> 
> ExPASy proteomics provides tools for obtaining and identifying protein sequences, investigating protein functions, structures and interactions, creating protein alignments, and identifying protein features, motifs and modifications.

## User Notes

- ExPASy Proteomics is a set of 231 tools from 38 databases (see the "Visual Guidance" page for a list) for proteomic analysis. 
- The ExPASy Proteomics "proteomic experiment" section provides experimental protocols.
- Tools that are official SIB resources offer support from the ExPASy Team, but external resources do not.  If the tool is a SIB resource it will have the red SIB icon next to it. 

## Ease of Use

- This site is essentially an organized collection of proteomic analysis tools.  The site is easy to navigate and many of the tools have their own help pages.
