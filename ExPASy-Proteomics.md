# ExPASy Proteomics

> In June 2011 the SIB ExPASy Bioformatics Resources Portal was launched by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. In particular, ExPASy has been designed, developed and maintained by the SIB Web Team in co-operation with several other SIB groups and ExPASy users. ExPASy is an extensible and integrative portal accessing many scientific resources, databases and software tools in different areas of life sciences. Refer to Features for more details. The portal enhances the original ExPASy server, previously known as "Expert Protein Analysis System"
