# The Natural Products Atlas

> The Natural Products Atlas is designed to cover all microbially-derived natural products published in the peer-reviewed primary scientific literature. This encompasses bacterial, fungal and cyanobacterial compounds, but does not include compounds from plants, invertebrates or other higher organisms unless these compounds have also been explicitly identified from a microbial source. Compounds from lichens and mushrooms and other higher fungi are included. Compounds from marine macro algae and diatoms are excluded.
>
> Compounds reported exclusively in conference proceedings, M.Sc. and Ph.D. theses, personal communications or the popular press are not included. Currently, the Natural Products Atlas does not include compounds from the patent literature. We are exploring mechanisms to incorporate compounds from patents in the next Atlas release.
