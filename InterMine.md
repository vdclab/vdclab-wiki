# InterMine

> InterMine is an open source data warehouse system, licensed under the LGPL 2.1. InterMine is used to create databases of biological data accessed by sophisticated web query tools. InterMine can be used to create databases from a single data set or can integrate multiple sources of data. Support is provided for several common biological formats and there is a framework for adding other data. InterMine includes a user-friendly web interface that works 'out of the box' and can be easily customised.

InterMine makes it easy to integrate multiple data sources into a single data warehouse. It has a core data model based on the sequence ontology and supports several biological data formats, allowing sysadmins to configure which organisms or data files are required. It is easy to extend the data model and integrate other data, with a web service API, clients in seven different languages, and an XML format to help import custom data.
