# The RNA Modification Database

> The RNA Modification Database is maintained as an extension of the initial version published in mid-1994, and consists of all RNA-derived ribonucleosides of known structure, including those from established sequence positions as well as those detected or characterized in mixtures from hydrolysates of RNA. The information provided permits access to the modified nucleoside literature both through provision of computer-searchable Chemical Abstracts registry numbers, as well as key literature citations.
