# MitoMiner v4.0

> MitoMiner is an integrated data warehouse of mammalian localisation evidence, phenotypes and diseases. This data has been integrated to allow the creation of sophisticated data mining queries spanning many different sources.
&NewLine;
MitoMiner is an integrated web resource of mitochondrial localisation evidence and phenotype data for mammals, but also contains resources for zebrafish and yeasts.

## Ease of Use

- The database is fairly self-explanatory and the tutorials are helpful if the User has a specific goal in mind. 

## User Notes

- MitoMiner Integrated Mitochondrial Protein Index (IMPI) is a collection of genes that encode proteins with strong evidence for cellular localisation within the mammalian mitochondrion. Queries can be performed to explore genes specifically within the IMPI dataset. 
- Many of the results link out to other, more specific genome databases (i.e. mouse-specific).
- This site is useful if Users are specifically looking for mitochondrial proteins or trying to determine if a protein could be mitochondrial.
