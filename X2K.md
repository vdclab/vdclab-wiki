# X2K Web

> X2K Web infers upstream regulatory networks from signatures of differentially expressed genes. By combining transcription factor enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network expansion, with kinase enrichment analysis, X2K Web produces inferred networks of transcription factors, proteins, and kinases predicted to regulate the expression of the inputted gene list. 
>
> X2K Web provides the results as tables and interactive vector graphic figures that can be readily embedded within publications.

## Website 

- [X2K Web *Main Page*](https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/X2K/)
 {.links-list}

## Help

- There is no formal help page, but there is step-by-step example on the home page. 

## Ease of Use

- The site is very easy to use and the pipeline is fully automated. 

## User Notes

- The site offers a standard pipeline: transcription factor enrichment, protein-protein interaction expansion, kinase enrichment analysis, and creation of an "eXpression2Kinases" network display.
- Input is a list of differentially expressed human genes. The final output is the eXpression2Kinases network. 
- Additional outputs include interactive bargraphs and downloadable spreadsheet tables of transcription factor and kinase enrichments and an interactive protein-protein interaction network.
