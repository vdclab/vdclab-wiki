# Protein Data Bank in Europe - Knowledge Base (PDBe-KB)

> PDBe-KB (Protein Data Bank in Europe - Knowledge Base) is a community-driven resource managed by the PDBe team, collating functional annotations and predictions for structure data in the PDB archive. PDBe-KB is a collaborative effort between PDBe and a diverse group of bioinformatics resources and research teams.
&NewLine;
PDBe-KB contains data contributed by projects such as SIFTS and FunPDBe and aims to place structures from the PDB in their biological context.
