# DBD-Hunter

> DNA-Binding Domain Hunter (DBD-Hunter) is a knowledge-based method for predicting DNA-binding proteins function from protein structure. The method combines structural comparison and evaluation of DNA-protein interaction energy, which is calculated use a statistical pair potential derived from crystal structures of DNA-protein complexes.
