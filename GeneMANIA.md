# GeneMANIA

> GeneMANIA finds other genes that are related to a set of input genes, using a very large set of functional association data. Association data include protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity. You can use GeneMANIA to find new members of a pathway or complex, find additional genes you may have missed in your screen or find new genes with a specific function, such as protein kinases. Your question is defined by the set of genes you input.

## Notes from users
- Visualizes related genes, similar to the STRING database
- Useful for finding additional related genes to query
- Helpful annotations for genes with links to where the annotations originate from
- limited to a few model organisms

## Ease of use
> The website is simple to use and easy to understand but the gene names need to be specific in order for the database to recognize the users query. The user should read the evidence for how genes are related to each other if genes are related from the "other" catagory.
