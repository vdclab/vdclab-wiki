# Genoscope - Microscope

> MicroScope offers many useful data-exploring functionalities, such as allowing users to perform (complex) queries, comparative genomic studies, and metabolic analyses. It also provides summary views of statistics and information for each genome as a whole.
&NewLine;
The MicroScope web interface (MaGe, for « Magnifying Genomes » ) has been specifically designed to assist curators in the evaluation of all available data needed for assigning the best possible annotation to a given gene product.
