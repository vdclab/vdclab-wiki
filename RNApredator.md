# RNAPredator

> The RNApredator software facilitates the prediction of sRNA-mRNA interactions in bacteria. Currently targets can be searched in more than 1300 bacterial species. RNApredator uses a dynamic programming approach to compute putative targets. The main machinery used by RNApredator to find targets is the program called RNAplex (Version 1.8.4).
&NewLine;
Post-processing steps allow to look at accessibility differences on the target mRNA before and after the binding of the sRNAs. It is further possible to make a Gene Ontology(GO) and pathways (KEGG) term enrichment analysis on a set of selected targets.
