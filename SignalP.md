# SignalP - 5.0

> The SignalP 5.0 server predicts the presence of signal peptides and the location of their cleavage sites in proteins from Archaea, Gram-positive Bacteria, Gram-negative Bacteria and Eukarya. In Bacteria and Archaea, SignalP 5.0 can discriminate between three types of signal peptides:
&NewLine;
**Sec/SPI:** "standard" secretory signal peptides transported by the Sec translocon and cleaved by Signal Peptidase I (Lep)
**Sec/SPII:** lipoprotein signal peptides transported by the Sec translocon and cleaved by Signal Peptidase II (Lsp)
**Tat/SPI:** Tat signal peptides transported by the Tat translocon and cleaved by Signal Peptidase I (Lep).
&NewLine;
SignalP 5.0 is based on a deep convolutional and recurrent neural network architecture including a conditional random field.
