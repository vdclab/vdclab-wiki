# SignalP - 5.0

> The SignalP 5.0 server predicts the presence of signal peptides and the location of their cleavage sites in proteins from Archaea, Gram-positive Bacteria, Gram-negative Bacteria and Eukarya. In Bacteria and Archaea, SignalP 5.0 can discriminate between three types of signal peptides:
&NewLine;
**Sec/SPI:** "standard" secretory signal peptides transported by the Sec translocon and cleaved by Signal Peptidase I (Lep)
**Sec/SPII:** lipoprotein signal peptides transported by the Sec translocon and cleaved by Signal Peptidase II (Lsp)
**Tat/SPI:** Tat signal peptides transported by the Tat translocon and cleaved by Signal Peptidase I (Lep).
&NewLine;
SignalP 5.0 is based on a deep convolutional and recurrent neural network architecture including a conditional random field.

## Notes from the user
- Results are given as a graph which show probability of each section of a sequence belonging to a signaling peptide
- There is an extensive guide to help the user understand their results


## Ease of use
> The user only needs to provide a protein sequence and select the report length to use the tool. The results are simple and quickly identify Sec or Tat signals and cleavage sites.
