# DBAli

> DBAli is a database that includes a coomprehensive all-against-all comparison of protein structures in the PDB database. All pairwise structural comparisons in DBAli have been obtained using the MAMMOTH program developed in the group of Prof. Angel R. Ortiz. All multiple structure alignments in DBAli have been obtained uwing the SALIGN command in MODELLER developed in the group of Prof. Andrej Sali.
>
> DBAli uses the Java applet JMol from Dan Gezelter and collaborators to visualize molecular structures. These are the requeriments in order to properly use the JMol applet. Alternatively, you can also download the Chimera program to visualize the superimposition PDB files generated by DBAli .
