# DisGeNET

> DisGeNET is a discovery platform containing one of the largest publicly available collections of genes and variants associated to human diseases. DisGeNET integrates data from expert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal models and the scientific literature.
>
> DisGeNET data are homogeneously annotated with controlled vocabularies and community-driven ontologies. Additionally, several original metrics are provided to assist the prioritization of genotypeâ€“phenotype relationships.
>
> The current version of DisGeNET (v7.0) contains 1,134,942 gene-disease associations (GDAs), between 21,671 genes and 30,170 diseases, disorders, traits, and clinical or abnormal human phenotypes, and 369,554 variant-disease associations (VDAs), between 194,515 variants and 14,155 diseases, traits, and phenotypes.
