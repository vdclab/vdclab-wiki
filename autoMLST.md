# autoMLST: Automated Multi-Locus Species Tree

> This server utilizes Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) to produce high-resolution species trees; this does not preform multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), a related classification method. The resulting phylogenetic tree also includes helpful annotations, such as species clade designations and secondary metabolite counts to aid natural product prospecting. 
>
> Distinct from currently available web-interfaces, autoMLST can automate selection of reference genomes and out-group organisms based on one or more query genomes. This enables a wide range of researchers to perform rigorous phylogenetic analyses more rapidly compared to manual MLSA workflows.
