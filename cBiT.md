# cBiT

> cBiT is the first repository that offers biomaterial-based transcriptomics data together with all relevant biomaterial metadata. cBiT was an initiative of the de Boer lab when still at the Merln Institute in Maastricht, and now at the department of BME at TU/e. cBiT is continuing to expand as part of Platform for Therapeutic Biomaterial Discovery at TU/e.
