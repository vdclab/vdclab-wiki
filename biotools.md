# Bio tools

>  Bio.tools provides a comprehensive registry of software and databases, facilitating researchers from across the spectrum of biological and biomedical science to find, understand, utilise and cite the resources they need in their day-to-day work.
&NewLine;
Everything from simple command-line tools and online services, through to databases and complex, multi-functional analysis workflows is included. Resources are described in a rigorous semantics and syntax, providing end-users with the convenience of concise, consistent and therefore comparable information.
&NewLine;
Each bio.tools entry is assigned a human-readable, unique identifier based on the resource name, e.g. biotools:signalp. These identifiers provide a persistent reference to our "Tool Cards" of essential information, as well as a means to trace resources and integrate bio.tools data with other resources.
&NewLine;
All the bio.tools data and technical components are available under open license and we warmly welcome you to get involved. bio.tools development is supported by ELIXIR - the European infrastructure for life science information.

## Notes from user
The registry should help the efficient discovery and use of tools and thus provide a useful support for life science projects
