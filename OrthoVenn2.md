# OrthoVenn2

> OrthoVenn is a web platform for comparison and annotation of orthologous gene clusters among multiple species. No installation or registration is required. It works on any operating system with a modern browser and Javascript enabled.
>
> OrthoVenn provides comprehensive coverage of vertebrates, metazoa, protists, fungi, plants and bacteria for identify orthologous gene clusters and supports user define species to upload customized protein sequences.
>
> OrthoVenn has an efficient and interactive graphic tool which provide a Venn diagram view for comparing multiple species protein sequences. The only thing user need to do is choosing species or upload protein sequences

## Website

- [OrthoVenn2 *Main Page*](https://orthovenn2.bioinfotoolkits.net/home)
 {.links-list}

## Notes from the user

- Lots of different organisms available for analysis
- The user can specify as few as two or as many organisms available on the database, beware the wait time for analysis for large lists
- Each cluster in the Venn diagram can be clicked on to see the members of the group

## Ease of use

This tool has exceptional user interface and is very easy to use. The results are neatly displayed, and the orthologous clusters have plenty of links to delve into in addition to making a great Venn diagram figure.
