# MetOSite

> The oxidation of protein-bound methionine to form methionine sulfoxide (MetO), has traditionally been regarded as an oxidative damage. However, growing evidences support the view of this reversible reaction as a regulatory post-translational modification (PTM).
>
>MetOSite currently contains 7342 methionine sulfoxide sites found in 3620 different proteins from 24 species, with Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana and Bacillus cereus as the main contributors. Each collected site has been classified according to the effect of its sulfoxidation on the biological properties of the modified protein.
>
> The mission of MetOSite is to provide manually curated data related to experimentally confirmed sulfoxidation sites, and the effect of such PTM on the protein properties.

## Website 

- [MetOSite *Main Page*](https://metosite.uma.es/)
 {.links-list}

## Ease of use
- The site is very easy to use, with well designed guidance from the home page.

## User Notes

- The site is useful to determine whether or not a protein of interest has been described as containing MetO sites.
- Results are based on literature searches, so results are very informative.
- Searches are done using a UniProt ID.
- Database data can be downloaded as a CSV, or users can work with the data on the MetOSite API UI.
- When available, the site gives you information about the outcome of sulfoxidation (i.e. gain/loss of protein activity, changes in protein stability, etc).

## Help

- There is no formal help page.
