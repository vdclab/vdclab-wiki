# MetOSite

> MetOSite currently contains 7342 methionine sulfoxide sites found in 3620 different proteins from 24 species, with Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana and Bacillus cereus as the main contributors. Each collected site has been classified according to the effect of its sulfoxidation on the biological properties of the modified protein.
>
> The mission of MetOSite is to provide manually curated data related to experimentally confirmed sulfoxidation sites, and the effect of such PTM on the protein properties.
