# SCPortalen

> The motivation for the development of this database was to enable easy access, integration and collaboration on single-cell datasets generated by the research community worldwide. The current version of the database integrate of single-cell metadata, cell images and sequence information. 
&NewLine;
As an added-value to the raw data, we performed manual curation and annotation of each dataset and conducted single-cell analysis of single-cell RNA-seq. The easy-to-use user interface of the database will enable biologist and computing researchers to search, explore, and download single-cell data and images.
