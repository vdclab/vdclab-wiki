# SCPortalen

> The motivation for the development of this database was to enable easy access, integration and collaboration on single-cell datasets generated by the research community worldwide. The current version of the database integrate of single-cell metadata, cell images and sequence information. 
&NewLine;
As an added-value to the raw data, we performed manual curation and annotation of each dataset and conducted single-cell analysis of single-cell RNA-seq. The easy-to-use user interface of the database will enable biologist and computing researchers to search, explore, and download single-cell data and images.

 ## Notes from the user
 - Each data set comes with a full QC report to verify data integrity of sequencing reads
 - Entries of single cell studies come with pre-analyzed figures for quick analysis by the user
 - Lots of data formats for downloads 
 
 ## Ease of use
 > While there is a comprehensive user guide, the user will need to familiarize themselves with the database and the search function.
