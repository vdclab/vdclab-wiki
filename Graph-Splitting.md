# Graph Splitting

> Graph Splitting (GS) is a brand-new phylogenetic analysis method, which can effectively resolve early evolution of protein families. Its accuracy and speed was proved by extensive evolutionary simulation, and its application to TIM-barrel superfamily highlighted instant evolution of protein-mediated pyrimidine biosynthesis at a transitional phase between the RNA world and the modern DNA-RNA-protein world.
