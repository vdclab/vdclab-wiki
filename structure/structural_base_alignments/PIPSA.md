# Protein Interaction Property Similarity Analysis (PIPSA)

> This PIPSA service is provided for the comparison of the electrostatic interaction properties of proteins. It permits the classification of proteins according to their interaction properties. PIPSA may assist in function assignment, the estimation of binding properties and enzyme kinetic parameters.
