# PHIDIAS

> The Pathogen-Host Interaction Data Integration and Analysis System (PHIDIAS) is a web-based module system and centralized resource for biomedical researchers to investigate integrated genome sequences, curated literature information, and gene expression data related to pathogen-host interactions (PHI, also called host-pathogen interactions or HPI) for pathogens with high priority in public health and biological defense. PHIDIAS is aimed at organizing and elucidating the fundamental PHI insights.
