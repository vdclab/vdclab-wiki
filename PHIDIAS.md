# PHIDIAS

> The Pathogen-Host Interaction Data Integration and Analysis System (PHIDIAS) is a web-based module system and centralized resource for biomedical researchers to investigate integrated genome sequences, curated literature information, and gene expression data related to pathogen-host interactions (PHI, also called host-pathogen interactions or HPI) for pathogens with high priority in public health and biological defense. PHIDIAS is aimed at organizing and elucidating the fundamental PHI insights.

## Website 

- [PHIDIAS *Main Page*](http://www.phidias.us/index.php)
 {.links-list}

## User Notes
- Website is biased heavily toward host-pathogen interactions, datasets and literature; additional cross-checking with annotations of other databases is necessary
- Website information is organized into several subsets by datatype and relevance:
1. Victor (virulence factors)
2. Phinfo (pathogen-host interaction information/literature search)
3. Phinet (molecular networks of host-pathogen interactions)
4. Phigen (genes related to host-pathogen interactions)
5. Pacodom (conserved protein domains from pathogen genomes)
6. BLAST Library (various BLAST search tools for pathogen-specific custom queries)

## Ease of Use
- Relatively easy to navigate, but more challenging to cross-reference; missing some hyperlinks or accessions of other databases that could facilitate this process
