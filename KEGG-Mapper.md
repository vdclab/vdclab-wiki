# KEGG Mapper

> KEGG Mapper is a collection of tools for KEGG mapping: most popular KEGG pathway mapping, as well as BRITE mapping and MODULE mapping. In this new release, fourteen existing tools were reorganized into just five tools. Three of them, "Reconstruct Pathway", "Search Pathway" and "Search&Color Pathway" allow multiple mapping operations to be done at the same time. The result is shown in multiple tabs in the result page. The other two are specialized tools, "Color Pathway" and "Join Brite", for mapping against a single pathway map or a single brite hierarchy/table file.
