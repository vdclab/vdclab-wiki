# ENDscript 2.0
> ENDscript is a Web server, which extracts and renders a comprehensive analysis of primary to quaternary protein structure information in an automated way.
&NewLine;
ENDscript is a tool for biologists and structural biologists, which allows generating with a few mouse clicks a set of detailed high quality figures and 3D interactive representations of their proteins of interest.
Hence, the experimenter can rapidly explore the structure of its favorite protein and identify the zones of conservation.

## User Notes

- PyMOL is required to take advantage of the ENDscript interactive representations.
- Results are displayed in a pop-up window, so users must ensure the results pop-up isn't blocked by their browsers.
- Results coloring and formatting explanations can be found in ESPript User Guide (see links, above).
